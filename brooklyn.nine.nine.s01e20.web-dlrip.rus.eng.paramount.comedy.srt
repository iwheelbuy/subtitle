1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,560
All right, gang, Diet Day Four.

2
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,761
How's everyone holding up?

3
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,864
Honestly, I'm going
to last forever.

4
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:09,968
You hear that, bitches?

5
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,502
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

6
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,104
This morning
the homeless guy on my stoop

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,305
said my skin looked dope.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,640
What's going on?

9
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:17,475
Why do you all have
matching bags?

10
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,978
We're doing a diet together.
My wife found it.

11
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:22,380
She heard about it
at Mommy And Me Graphic Design.

12
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,883
Wait, it might've been
Toddler Karate.

13
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:27,198
She takes our little
ladies to so many classes,

14
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,353
I can't keep it straight.

15
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,188
Childhood is truly
a time of wonder.

16
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,423
<i>This diet is
very scientific, sir.</i>

17
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,858
All the meals are pre-planned
and delivered to your doorstep.

18
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,583
This is our breakfast:

19
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,808
An orange wedge, three cashew nuts...
and a solitarie grape.

20
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,702
It's actually more
than you realize.

21
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:44,171
Sometimes I can't even finish
all the grape.

22
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:46,640
This seems unnecessary to me.
You're all in perfect shape.

23
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,376
You can always
be healthier, sir.

24
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,910
<i>And I like the challenge.</i>

25
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,312
Plus, it's good team building.

26
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,314
We're gonna get
through this together.

27
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:55,182
Hey, guys, pro tip.

28
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:58,052
Lick the baggie.
There's food molecules in there.

29
00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,720
Oh.
Oh, that's so smart.

30
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,589
Mmm.

31
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:09,651
<font color=#00FFFF>Sync & corrections by Alice

32
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:25,646
What are you doing here?
Isn't it your day off?

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,848
<i>Yeah, stalker.</i>
<i>It is my day off.</i>

34
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:29,216
But I am here to meet Charles.

35
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,818
Did you hear what he did
last night?

36
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:32,953
Drink it, Jake.
Drink it.

37
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:35,923
What's up your tiny sleeve?

38
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:38,592
Oh!

39
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,327
Why is there a bow tie in here?

40
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:41,562
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,230
Jake Peralta,
will you be my best man?

42
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:46,367
Yes. Yes!
A thousand times, yes!

43
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:48,469
Wow.
Best man.

44
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:51,172
So are you gonna set up shop
in a strip club?

45
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,940
What kind of shop
would I set up?

46
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:55,476
Hand sanitizer.
I would sell hand sanitizer.

47
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,811
And no.

48
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,245
I was hoping
that my best-man duties

49
00:01:58,246 --> 00:01:59,547
would be all whiskey
and cigars,

50
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,048
but this is Charles
we're talking about.

51
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,084
So we've got two straight days
of wedding planning,

52
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,152
plus, he gave me this to prep.

53
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,455
<i>Fancy</i> Brudgom!

54
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,523
It means "fancy groom"
in Danish.

55
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:10,925
According to Charles,

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,460
the Danes throw the most
beautiful weddings in the world

57
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:15,329
and the most violent funerals.

58
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:18,332
This does not look like
something you'd be into.

59
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,600
Normally, yes.

60
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,502
But I am now Charles's
<i>forlover...</i>

61
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,204
"best man," Danish.

62
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:25,606
So it is my duty
to support him,

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,743
no matter what weird, crazy,
Charles-y ideas he has.

64
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:29,744
Let's do this.

65
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,912
There he is!
My groom!

66
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,748
Hello, my big,
beautiful B.M.!

67
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:35,383
"Best man."
Just "best man" is fine.

68
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,517
I hope you're rested.

69
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:37,785
We're gonna be
on our feet all day.

70
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,854
I am totally prepared.
I even bought some nurse shoes.

71
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,856
I love them!
Mm-hmm!

72
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,392
Let me grab this!
Let me grab this!

73
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:46,127
- Let me grab this!
- Grab me!

74
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,662
First stop,<i> kagesmagning!</i>
Cake tasting!

75
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:50,531
Wow.

76
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,933
You wanted to see me, sir?

77
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,635
I understand you stopped

78
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,470
by the patrol officers'
morning briefing.

79
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,772
Yeah.

80
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,240
Officer Deetmore helped me out
with my crime scene,

81
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:00,541
so I gave him a little
thank-you present.

82
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,942
Hey, Deetmore.

83
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:04,045
If you're gonna bag evidence
like a five-year-old,

84
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,980
you should have
the proper tools.

85
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,882
It's a "My First Police Kit."

86
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,750
The walkie-talkie
blows bubbles.

87
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,019
Hope you can handle it.

88
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,159
He mislabeled the weapon,
like an idiot.

89
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:19,493
And it almost got filed
with the wrong case.

90
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,062
He could've blown
months of work!

91
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,431
You humiliated Officer Deetmore
in front of his peers.

92
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:26,033
He submitted an official
complaint against you.

93
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,228
Did he fill it out in crayon?

94
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,469
No.

95
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:30,604
But he did use a green pen,
which seems crazy to me.

96
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,674
The good news is, if you go
down there and apologize,

97
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,276
he'll let the whole thing go.

98
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,911
Fine. I'm great
at apologizing.

99
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,179
I'm a very sweet person.

100
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,047
Out of my way, Chunk.

101
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,582
Ooh!

102
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:46,320
Jake, I got to tell ya,
the engaged life is amazing,

103
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,589
- especially sexually.
- Well, I don't want to pry.

104
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,257
- You're not prying. I want
you to know this.    - No.

105
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,360
Vivian and I have a wonderful
intercourse itinerary

106
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,595
- that we have planned.
- Ah, ha!

107
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,029
I'm usually more
of a chocolate guy,

108
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,199
but this one's closer,
so I'm gonna do that.

109
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,167
Oh!
Hot, hot!

110
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,302
Spicy cake!
Why?

111
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:02,903
That's habanero pepper
frosting,

112
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,072
because our marriage
is going to...

113
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,943
Unless you think
it's a bad idea.

114
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:11,078
No.

115
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:13,214
Sounds like
a great idea, Oprah.

116
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:16,684
Two... One.

117
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,285
Okay, be kind.

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,687
I don't have
a model's body like you.

119
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,055
Come on, show me what you got.

120
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,659
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.

121
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,394
Liberace, Diane keaton.

122
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:27,595
Roger that.

123
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:29,163
God.

124
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:33,167
<i>Charles, Charles.</i>
<i>You're not Scottish.</i>

125
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,802
<i>Yeah, get back in there,</i>
<i>Braveheart.</i>

126
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,537
Summer linen suit...

127
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,439
casual but classic.

128
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:39,974
Actually not bad.

129
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:42,043
One question...
can you see my underwear?

130
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:44,712
Ah, thong!
Why are you wearing a thong?

131
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,113
It's my something borrowed.

132
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,182
Get back in there.

133
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:50,384
Yes!

134
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,452
Lunchtime.
Wait's over.

135
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:53,087
- That was easy.
- Totally.

136
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,422
I feel like we just
had our snack

137
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,856
an hour and 17 minutes ago.

138
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,658
I never got into diets...

139
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:00,227
Though I did take diet pills
in the '70s.

140
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:03,964
I love these pills.
They give me so much energy.

141
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:07,101
And I can eat whatever I want.

142
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,303
Oh, God!

143
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,008
He's dead!

144
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,344
Actually, I was in a coma.

145
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,312
When I woke up,
I had so much mail.

146
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,614
Weight-loss science
has come a long way since then.

147
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,550
Mm-hmm.

148
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:25,653
"Ingredients... carrot."
Got to respect that.

149
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,855
Damn, Gina!

150
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,056
What is that?

151
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,325
Oh, it's a sloppy Jessica.

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,528
Mac 'n' cheese, chili,
pizza on a bun.

153
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:36,163
<i>It's everything</i>
<i>I've wanted to eat</i>

154
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,699
for the last 48 hours.

155
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,202
Mmm. Mmm.

156
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:42,436
What happened?

157
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,106
I thought you were gonna
"last forever, bitches!"

158
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,907
Turns out I gave up easy.

159
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,542
You hear that, bitches?

160
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,412
I gave up so easy!

161
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:53,748
Thank you!

162
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,103
Hey, are you sure
it's a good idea

163
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:56,984
to eat all this shawarma
right before your tux fitting?

164
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,319
Oh, yeah.

165
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,687
I'm not gonna be one
of those grooms who doesn't eat.

166
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,088
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

167
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,590
Thanks for being
so supportive all day.

168
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:04,759
Best man...
whatever you need, I will do.

169
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,560
Actually, there is one thing.

170
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:08,262
Do you have a pen I could borrow
to sign these forms?

171
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,498
You bet I don't have a pen.
I never do.

172
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,099
But I will get you one.

173
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,801
What is it, some sort
of marriage license thingy?

174
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,202
Oh, no, it's
my retirement paperwork.

175
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,071
What? Shut up. What? Yeah.

176
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,873
Vivian got a job
in suburban Ottawa.

177
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,208
She wants me to retire from
the NYPD and go with her.

178
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,543
Retire?

179
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,378
Boyle, we're supposed to
die on the force together...

180
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:25,780
me in a big explosion,

181
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,782
and you committing suicide
at my funeral out of respect.

182
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,050
I know.

183
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,352
But Vivian needs to make
this move for her career,

184
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,020
and I'm excited to go.

185
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,755
I mean,
suburban Ottawa's great.

186
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,290
It has everything
Brooklyn does.

187
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:38,225
- Really?
- Yes...

188
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,861
Other than my job
and my friends and my family,

189
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:44,098
you, interesting people,
museums, restaurants,

190
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,067
every other reason
that I have to live.

191
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,235
Okay, I'm kind of picking up
on a couple of clues

192
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,271
that you maybe don't want
to retire in Canada.

193
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,539
Oh, my God.

194
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,640
Jake, you're such
an amazing detective.

195
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,474
I don't want to go.

196
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:57,889
Okay, Boyle, let's strategize

197
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,190
on how you're gonna tell Vivian

198
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,558
that you don't want to move
to Canada.

199
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:01,959
No, Jake, I'm not
gonna say anything.

200
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:03,161
Just drop it.

201
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,429
We have the perfect
relationship.

202
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:05,596
We've never fought.

203
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:06,698
I don't want to mess up
and ruin it.

204
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:07,865
She's my everything.

205
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,233
- Move your testicles to the left.
- 10-4.

206
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:10,401
She's your fiancee.

207
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:11,903
You can't be scared
to talk to her.

208
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:13,371
Testicles to the right...

209
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,773
You know, can we actually cool it
on the testicles for a minute?

210
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,442
No, I'm on the testicle part.

211
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,878
Honestly, Jake, I wouldn't
even know how to bring it up.

212
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,046
What if it goes badly?

213
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,048
It won't.
Just tell her how you feel.

214
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,950
Say something like,
"Vivian, I love you,

215
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,485
but we need to talk
about Ottawa."

216
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,621
Right. And then she'll say,
"you're a selfish man-pig,

217
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:32,990
and I hope you die alone,
and I never loved you."

218
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,759
Oh, God.
She never loved me.

219
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,194
She's not gonna say any of that

220
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,029
because she's not
criminally insane.

221
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:39,430
<i>Okay, just calm down.</i>

222
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:40,786
We'll think of something
together.

223
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,133
We're going
to the stationery store next.

224
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,368
We can write
a bunch of stuff down.

225
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,570
It's gonna be all right.
Take a deep breath.

226
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:47,171
No deep breaths.

227
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,973
Makes the testicles clap.

228
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,375
Mm.

229
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,976
Detective Diaz.

230
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,945
How's your apology
to officer Deetmore coming?

231
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,580
I've been working on a letter
to send him.

232
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:57,248
Yes, I saw a draft of it
on your desk.

233
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,616
What did you think?

234
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,185
It was so horrifying,
I had to destroy the whole pad.

235
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,990
Just go downstairs
and apologize.

236
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,126
Fine.
I'll say, "I'm sorry."

237
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,194
No, be sincere, like this...

238
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,196
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

239
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,198
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,400
I'm sorry.

241
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:16,434
I'm sorry.

242
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,403
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:19,837
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

244
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:21,239
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,474
Good.
That's the one.

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
Still working
on that afternoon almond?

247
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:29,530
I've been sucking on it so long,
it's smooth.

248
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,499
- It's like sea glass.
- You do you.

249
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,537
I'll get that for you, Ames.

250
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,875
Oops!

251
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,109
Butter feet...
sorry about that.

252
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,746
Sorry? You bumbling
son of a bitch!

253
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,581
You just ruined my life!

254
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:49,050
I hope you get hit by a truck

255
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:50,585
and a dog takes a dump
on your face!

256
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,752
Nothing to see here...

257
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:53,254
just a little
hypoglycemic rage.

258
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,388
Move along.

259
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:57,091
I'm so sorry, Hitchcock.
That's not me.

260
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,793
I'm never like that.

261
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,294
That's okay.
It was my fault.

262
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,196
I shouldn't have bumped
your cashew.

263
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,099
Cashew?
It was an almond, you idiot!

264
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,901
I hope you drown in a tub!

265
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:10,705
I hope you have aneurysm
after aneurysm after aneurysm!

266
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,273
<i>Okay, buddy.</i>

267
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:13,947
We have got some great
opening lines here,

268
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,277
three very reasonable
explanations

269
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:17,812
as to why you don't want
to go to Canada,

270
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:21,716
and four very attractive options
for your invitation card stock.

271
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,685
Well, I like
" Romantic Opening 'C.' "

272
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,787
this page about how my life
is New York,

273
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:29,924
and I love the Chantilly Ecru
paper for place cards.

274
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,659
That is an excellent choice.

275
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,628
Those are all
excellent choices.

276
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,629
You can do this.

277
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:35,943
You're a smart
and wonderful man.

278
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,732
With fantastic handwriting.

279
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:39,233
Sure, with fantastic
handwriting.

280
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,668
You really think so?

281
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,937
Yeah, I think that you could be
a professional calligrapher.

282
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:45,473
Charles,
a professional calligrapher.

283
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,441
You can do anything,

284
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,977
including, but not limited to,
talking to Vivian.

285
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,847
Right.
Right. Right.

286
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,682
Look, I know
it's gonna be hard.

287
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,117
And she might even
get mad at you.

288
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,119
But I promise you will be back
to doing weird sex stuff

289
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,287
together in no time.

290
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:01,322
All right.

291
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,624
All right,
I'm gonna go talk to Vivi.

292
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,193
Great idea, buddy!
Eh?

293
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,328
- Yep!
- <i>Yeah!</i>

294
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,430
So who's gonna pay
for the paper?

295
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:12,433
It's gonna be $250.

296
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,335
Her name is Amy Santiago.

297
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,404
<i>Lick, lick, lick.</i>

298
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,706
It's an ice cream cone.

299
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,108
You can't tempt me, traitor,

300
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:23,678
not when I got this big,
juicy cantaloupe wedge

301
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:26,013
to keep me company.

302
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,982
It's so thin
I can see through it.

303
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:29,850
Santiago!

304
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,086
Come hold this so it looks
bigger in your tiny hand.

305
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,655
Aw, Amy left the building
20 minutes ago.

306
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,990
That doesn't make sense.

307
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,259
Santiago loves cantaloupe time.

308
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,894
We wrote a song about it.

309
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,533
It's just nonsense without
her singing the high parts.

310
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,835
Where is she?

311
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,673
<i>Amy, where are you?
It's cantaloupe time!</i>

312
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,443
Santiago!
Stop!

313
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:56,611
It's not too late.

314
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:57,979
<i>I failed, Sarge.</i>

315
00:10:58,013 --> 00:11:00,348
This is my second burger.

316
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,650
Okay, I lied.
It's my fourth!

317
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:05,620
You both betrayed me.
That's okay.

318
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,321
I can do this all on my own,
I don't need you!

319
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,023
<i>I can even sing the high parts!</i>

320
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,196
Traitors!

321
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,732
Officer Deetmore...

322
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,133
I came down here
to say I'm sorry.

323
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,735
Oh, good.
Go ahead.

324
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,703
No, that was it. I did it.
I said, "I'm sorry."

325
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:23,704
Hey, I said it again.

326
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:24,779
Now I got one in the bank,

327
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,007
so I can do
whatever I want to you.

328
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,241
What are you even sorry for?

329
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,342
Come on, man.

330
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,378
I said the words.
I paused afterwards.

331
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,413
I even averted my gaze
to make you feel like the Alpha.

332
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:33,714
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

333
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,183
I'd like you to apologize
like you mean it.

334
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,185
Fine.

335
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,888
I'm sorry
you screwed up my case.

336
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:43,357
I'm sorry
you're a terrible cop.

337
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,060
I'm sorry for your goat face
and your rodent brain

338
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:48,763
and your weird goose body.

339
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,698
I meant all of that.

340
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,568
Hope you feel better.

341
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,704
Hey!

342
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,839
So? How'd it go
with Vivian last night?

343
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,808
Great.
It went so great.

344
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:03,678
I went to her apartment.
I sat down face-to-face.

345
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,413
Then I panicked
and totally bailed.

346
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:06,614
Oh, no.

347
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,316
But the good news is,
she's on her way here,

348
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,351
- and you're gonna talk to her for me.
- Oh, no.

349
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:11,619
Just tell her I absolutely
shouldn't retire

350
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,087
and move to Canada,
but don't tell her I think that.

351
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,522
- Hi!
- Hi, Vivian!

352
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:15,523
Mwah!

353
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:16,524
Hi, Jake!

354
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:19,293
Vivian!

355
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,268
Jake, you're so sweet!

356
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,603
Charles told me you insisted
that I come to breakfast.

357
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,706
Because of it being
such an important one.

358
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,873
Meal, I mean.

359
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,675
You know that in ancient Egypt,

360
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,377
the peasants drank beer
for breakfast?

361
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,846
Well, that explains why all
their buildings were crooked.

362
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,648
Charles, can I see you
in the bathroom for a second?

363
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,783
I've got a mole on my back
that needs a looking-at,

364
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,218
and Charles has eyes.

365
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,053
I do.

366
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:44,522
All right,
so let's see that mole.

367
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,858
What? Get off of me!
That was a fake excuse.

368
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,226
Of course.
Totally.

369
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,695
Look, I can't talk to Vivian
for you. This is crazy.

370
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,931
I tried talking to
her, just like we practiced.

371
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,532
But every time
I bring up Ottawa,

372
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,367
she says how excited
she is about our future.

373
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,569
Then we made love.

374
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:58,870
Don't say "made love."

375
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,038
Fine, we had wonder-sex.

376
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,439
I don't want to know
what that is.

377
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,574
I don't want to move to Canada.

378
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,908
But I can't lose her.

379
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:06,244
You're my best man.
Please help me.

380
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,580
Fine. I'll try.

381
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,515
Okay,
but bring it up naturally,

382
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:11,883
so she doesn't think
I put you up to it.

383
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,151
Sure.
How hard could that be?

384
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,986
I'm constantly talking
about suburban Ottawa.

385
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,823
Wait, don't go!
I still have to pee.

386
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,325
Why would I stay for that?

387
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:22,794
Is it cool if I just stare
at your croissants

388
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:23,995
for a little while?

389
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,096
Sarge!

390
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,564
You need to stop this diet.

391
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,166
Amy and I folded.
You won.

392
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,069
It's not a competition.
We were on the same team,

393
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,472
until you deserted me
for team eating food!

394
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:36,908
Was that a good burn?
I'm too hungry to tell.

395
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,011
It was a great burn, sir.
Now please eat. You look weak.

396
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,413
I'm fine.

397
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,981
I am stronger than ever!

398
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,016
Watch this.

399
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,352
Sarge, what are you...
what are you doing?

400
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:48,453
No, no, no, no, no.
No!

401
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,089
Wow.

402
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:55,527
See? I'm fine!

403
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,262
What is happening?

404
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,198
Just a tummy gurgle.
Diet messed up my system.

405
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,933
Oh, no.

406
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,940
Go back inside!

407
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,543
Are you talking to us
or the fart?

408
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:15,146
So, Vivian,
do you ever go watch hockey?

409
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,115
No, I'm not one for sports.

410
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,450
Of course you're not.

411
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:22,287
My graduate student told me the
craziest story about her family.

412
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,888
That's hilarious!

413
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,124
Hey, can you pass me
the maple syrup, please?

414
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,660
Speaking of, where does the best
maple syrup come from again?

415
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,328
Vermont.

416
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,297
Oh, and Canada.

417
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,632
Canada?
Hey, that reminds me.

418
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,634
Weren't the two of you talking
about maybe moving there?

419
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,303
Oh, yeah, we are so excited

420
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,505
to start this new chapter
of our lives together.

421
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,240
Yeah. Well, although
I have to say,

422
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:45,744
as someone who's read many of the
older chapters in Charles's life,

423
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,145
I wonder if that's
the best thing for him.

424
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,881
That's so sweet of you
to care, but...

425
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:52,217
Chuck is excited about moving
to Canada, right, baby?

426
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,719
Mm, mouth full.
I love you.

427
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:56,654
But what about his job
and all of his friends

428
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,590
and his Brooklyn-based
pizza blog?

429
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,492
Do they even have pizza
in Canada?

430
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,894
Yes, it's puffier,
and it's sweet.

431
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,562
It's called Manitoba Sauce Cake.

432
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:06,531
Okay, there's no way
Charles wants that.

433
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,700
Jake, I think
you're overstepping here.

434
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,502
Charles and I both
want to move to Canada.

435
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:14,439
Is that true, Charles?
Is that what you want?

436
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,443
Uh, yeah.

437
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:21,746
I want to retire from the force
and move to Ottawa with Vivian.

438
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:25,216
And frankly, I have no idea
why you're getting involved.

439
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,786
And no one asked
for your stupid opinion.

440
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,521
Vivi...

441
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,723
We're leaving.

442
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,124
What?

443
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,859
Detective Diaz...

444
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,828
I gather that, once again,
things did not go well

445
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:38,096
with Officer Deetmore.

446
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,632
All due respect, sir,
it's how I was trained.

447
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,367
You mess up,
you get made fun of.

448
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,035
It's like scientist
zapping a rat

449
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,403
when it messes up in a maze.

450
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,705
Oh, I get it.

451
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,106
When I was a young officer,

452
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,942
I was that rat and got zapped.

453
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:52,610
And all I wanted
was to be captain

454
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:53,945
and throw some lightning bolts.

455
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:56,748
Emperor Palpatine.

456
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,550
I do not know who that is.

457
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,786
But a real leader doesn't zap
people when they mess up.

458
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:05,090
They teach them
how to fix the problem.

459
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,592
I think you're a leader.

460
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,060
So act like one.

461
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:12,297
I'll try.
I'm sorry.

462
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:15,033
Please, Diaz.
No need to make a scene.

463
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,503
- I can't believe he's moving to Canada.
- I know.

464
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:21,373
And I tried to help him, and he
fully threw me under the bus.

465
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:22,674
So I quit as best man.

466
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,942
- Jake.
- What?

467
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,276
I did everything right.

468
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,445
I was loyal. I put up
with all his dumb ideas,

469
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,248
his spicy cake, his champagne
made out of olives,

470
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,617
reading his vows as a recipe.

471
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,619
"One teaspoon eternal love,

472
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,921
a dash of peeing
with the door open."

473
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,590
Okay.
That's hard to hear.

474
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,958
Yeah.

475
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:41,760
I just don't understand
why he's being so weird.

476
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,528
I can't believe he would
turn on me like this.

477
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:44,863
He's not being himself.

478
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:46,865
Maybe because he's facing
a terrible decision

479
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,100
and he doesn't know what to do.

480
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,002
Yeah, that sounds right.

481
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,804
I think he needs
his farm lover.

482
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,139
It's pronounced "for-lohver."

483
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,440
I don't have time
to teach you Danish.

484
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,508
I gotta go help Charles!

485
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,009
I'll find out where he is
and text you.

486
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,543
<i>That would be helpful!</i>

487
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,870
- Charles, get in the car.
- No!

488
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,639
Go to heck!

489
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,157
Don't siren me.

490
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:10,760
You quit on me as best man,
I'm not talking to you.

491
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:14,130
Police.
Stop walking.

492
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,034
Ah, I hate
that I'm so by the book.

493
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,602
Listen, Boyle,

494
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,803
you're not handing in
those retirement papers

495
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,038
without telling Vivian
how you feel.

496
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,205
I won't let you.

497
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,880
Oh, really?
And how are you gonna stop me?

498
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:25,875
Baton to the knee.

499
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,977
Baton to the knee?

500
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,313
Ahh! Oh!

501
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,716
Hey, Deetmore.

502
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,986
I'm sorry for making fun of you
in front of everybody...

503
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,188
And also for making fun of you
behind your back.

504
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,891
Didn't know you did that,
but thank you for the apology.

505
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,259
I'm not done.

506
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,161
Also, I'm sorry for making fun
of you during my book club.

507
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,228
Those people don't even
know you.

508
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:47,330
That was uncool.

509
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,631
Also, I'm sorry...

510
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:49,999
it's okay.
I get it.

511
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,200
No.

512
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:53,202
Also, I'm sorry that
I didn't take the time

513
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,905
to show you
how to fix your mistake.

514
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,974
Come on,
we can go over it upstairs.

515
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,576
Thanks.
That'd be great.

516
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,979
Oh, one more sorry.

517
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,914
You're about to see a drawing
I did of you in the elevator.

518
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,882
Just remember I was really
pissed at you at the time.

519
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,356
I'm unquitting
as your best man.

520
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,690
Oh, how kind of you.

521
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,659
Are you also taking me
to the knee hospital?

522
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,127
Your knee is fine.

523
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,462
Besides, you had it coming

524
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,730
for throwing me
under the bus like that.

525
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,065
I'm sorry.
I was terrible to you.

526
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,668
It's just I don't know
what to do.

527
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,370
I know, it's tough.

528
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,704
But I'm here to support you

529
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,840
and not just in your weird,
awful wedding decisions.

530
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,174
"Awful"?

531
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,343
Uh-oh. Did I just plan
the worst wedding in history?

532
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:37,013
Second worst.
Red Wedding,<i> Game Of Thrones.</i>

533
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,382
<i>And, no, your wedding</i>
<i>is gonna be incredible</i>

534
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,050
because it's exactly
what you want.

535
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,952
What you don't want
is to go to Canada.

536
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,421
So I don't care how many buses
you throw me under,

537
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,023
I'm making you talk to Vivian.

538
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:50,459
Okay, thanks.
You're right.

539
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:53,195
And you know what?
I'm ready.

540
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,630
No, I'm not!
I'm running away!

541
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,132
Boyle, no!

542
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,886
I'm not ready! I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!

543
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,569
Hey, superstar.

544
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,972
Why the long fart?
Oh, I meant "face."

545
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:04,307
Why the long face?

546
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,441
Keep walking, Linetti.

547
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,110
Okay, but this shake
is really good.

548
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,245
Listen. Shh, shh.

549
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,579
Listen.

550
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:13,616
That's it!
I give up.

551
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,251
Why do you care so much
about this diet?

552
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,386
Just stop.
You're in perfect shape.

553
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,121
Mm! Amen!

554
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:20,456
I'm not doing it for me.

555
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,124
My wife is on a diet.

556
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:23,759
She's a little self-conscious
about her body

557
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,127
since giving birth to twins.

558
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,495
It's crazy!

559
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,697
I think she looks perfect,

560
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,965
and I tell her that
all the time.

561
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,500
Mm, and I love
that you do that, Terry.

562
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:33,536
She's running around
after those girls all day,

563
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,004
and I'm not there to help out.

564
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,406
This was one thing
I thought I could do with her.

565
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,942
But I'm too weak.

566
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,612
Just hand me that milkshake.

567
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:45,081
Okay.

568
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,483
Hey, what are you doing?
What...

569
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:48,918
Thank you.

570
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,286
We are still a team,

571
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,189
and we will keep you from eating
so you can support your wife.

572
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:54,890
Thank you, team.

573
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,206
However, just to be clear,
Gina and I are still gonna eat.

574
00:19:57,227 --> 00:20:00,162
I'm eating right now,
Terry... corndog.

575
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,031
Come on.
There we go.

576
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,034
You got this, all right?

577
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,804
Ah, hello, Vivian.
Charles has something

578
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,207
he'd like to say.

579
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:12,675
In case he tries to flee.

580
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,982
Vivian...

581
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,651
We need to talk about Ottawa.

582
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:25,176
___

583
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,761
Jake.

584
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,796
Oh.

585
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:37,333
Hey.

586
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,001
How'd it go?
Everything okay?

587
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:41,103
Vivian and I talked for hours.

588
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,139
There's a lot more to discuss,
but it's a start.

589
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,573
And you were right.
She didn't dump me.

590
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,910
You did good.
I know you were scared.

591
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:50,112
Hey...

592
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:53,149
Your duties as best man
aren't over yet.

593
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,518
What?
Whiskey and cigars!

594
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,253
Mm-hmm.

595
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,155
Thanks for being
the best best man.

596
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,557
To the fancy<i> brudgom!</i>

597
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,996
Ah! Ah, spicy!
Why is that spicy?

598
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,731
Not a doctor. Shh.

599
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:18,164

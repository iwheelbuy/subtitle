1
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:04,773
Whoa. What's with the cast?
I sprained my wrist.

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:05,907
Oh, no!
What happened?

3
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:07,609
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

4
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,777
Yeah! Geez, Amy.

5
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:09,811
<i>Back off.</i>

6
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:11,079
Leave the guy alone.

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,347
All right,
huddle up, everybody.

8
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,615
<i>Bring it in, bring it in!</i>

9
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:14,950
<i>So he wouldn't say what happened,</i>

10
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:16,451
which can only mean one thing.

11
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:18,720
- He's in a fight club.
<i>-  No.</i>

12
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:21,656
He did it doing something he's
embarrassed by, like smiling.

13
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:23,158
Only question is, how do you
hurt your arm smiling?

14
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:24,459
<i>Could be a sports injury.</i>

15
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,095
I sprained my wrist in college
playing field hockey.

16
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:29,564
Men's field hockey?
Yeah.

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,299
It's much more violent
than the women's game.

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,902
We're not allowed to wear anything
that protects our breasts.

19
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,604
Attention, everyone,
I can hear you speculating

20
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:38,607
about the nature and origin
of my injury from my office.

21
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,409
I tripped over an uneven sidewalk.

22
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,378
<i>I did not think
it was relevant to your jobs,</i>

23
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,915
the jobs which you should all
be doing right now.

24
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,516
<i>Get to work.</i>

25
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,055
Do you wanna know
how I actually hurt my wrist?

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,890
Yes.

27
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,559
I was hula-hooping.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,895
Kevin and I attend a class
for fitness and for fun.

29
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:01,930
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,899
I've mastered all the moves.

31
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,034
The pizza toss...

32
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,202
The tornado...

33
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:10,438
The scorpion, the oopsie doodle.

34
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:13,708
Why are you telling me this?

35
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,878
Because no one...
Will ever believe you.

36
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,580
<i>No. No!</i>

37
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:23,919
You sick son of a bitch.

38

Hey, hey!

40
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:48,316
What has three thumbs
and just made another arrest?

41
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:50,245
This guy!

42
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,280
It doesn't work if you don't
put your thumb up.

43
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,448
Thank you!

44
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:56,084
23 solves in one month.
New precinct record!

45
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,485
Yeah!

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Thank you, thanks.

47
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,288
Dance with me, Jakey.

48
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:04,125
Ha! No, and I will never dance
to that song.

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,094
Wait to go, Jakey!
Whoa!

50
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:08,797
Are those thumbtacks?
What the hell, Scully?

51
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,271
I thought they'd make good confetti.

52
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,900
Why?

53
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,702
This took a lot of hard work
and a lot of late nights.

54
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,203
Take the weekend off, Peralta.

55
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:16,304
<i>Thank you.</i>

56
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,906
You know, I actually might.

57
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:20,275
I'm severely sleep-deprived
and I'm way behind on laundry.

58
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,143
Good work.
Oh.

59
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,045
That's nice.

60
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:25,280
Hey!

61
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:26,548
What's with the bag?

62
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,084
Are you going on a cruise
with your mom... in 1913?

63
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,019
This is a very stylish bag.

64
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,888
<i>Teddy and I are going to
the Berkshires for the weekend.</i>

65
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,890
Oh, for like a police conference?

66
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:36,725
Nope, just a romantic getaway.

67
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,293
Wow!

68
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:40,495
That's great.
I know.

69
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:43,565
We're kind of taking things
to the next level.

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,833
What are you doing this weekend?

71
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,935
Oh, opposite of the Berkshires.

72
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:49,471
Work-shires.
Working, whole weekend.

73
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,939
Fighting crime.

74
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,674
I thought you were taking
the weekend off to do your laundry.

75
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:56,745
Does crime take the weekend off
to do its laundry, Scully?

76
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,681
No, it doesn't.
Sorry.

77
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,618
Can I call you back?
Bye.

78
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,720
What's up?
Looking for paper towels.

79
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,556
What are you doing in here?
Talking to Vivian.

80
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:10,258
We're still trying to figure out
whether we should move to Canada.

81
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,660
It's awful!

82
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,695
Thank God it hasn't affected
how much we bathe together.

83
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,729
Almost never?

84
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,897
All the time.

85
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,199
<i>Thing is it's so hard to talk at work</i>

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,300
<i>because there's no privacy.</i>

87
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:21,369
The roof is freezing, the
holding cell is full of perps,

88
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,305
and their romantic advice is not great.

89
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,508
It's always to tell Vivian,
"bitch, get your life right!"

90
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,044
<i>I tried it.
She did not like it.</i>

91
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,645
Let me work on it.

92
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,681
Ah.

93
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:38,486
Hands up, cop.

94
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:39,921
Hey... no, no.
Oh, no, no!

95
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:41,189
It's Teddy, your boyfriend!

96
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,458
Aww, boyfriend.
Yeah.

97
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,993
Can you release my arm?

98
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,261
Oh, yeah!
Sorry.

99
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:47,429
Good one.

100
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,597
Thanks.

101
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:49,998
What are you doing here?

102
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,133
Oh, I just wanted to see you
before we left for the weekend.

103
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,935
<i>Aw, that's so gross.</i>

104
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:55,360
What's this weekend?

105
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:56,872
We rented a cabin in the Berkshires.

106
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,773
We're taking a couples cooking class,

107
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:00,365
and there's this great antiques fair.

108
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:04,179
Sounds like you two have a wonderful
lesbian vacation planned.

109
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:07,349
<i>Now my question is,</i> will you
be back tomorrow afternoon?

110
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,884
Because that is when you promised Holt

111
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:11,386
you'd help with
his community outreach meeting.

112
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,988
That's this weekend?

113
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,823
I totally forgot.

114
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,658
How did I let the Captain
talk me into that?

115
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,759
Excuse me, everyone.

116
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:18,760
Would one of you be willing to...

117
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:19,995
Me! I'll do it!

118
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,678
I volunteer all my time.

119
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,099
Crap.
What am I gonna do?

120
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,668
Well, it's okay.
We can reschedule.

121
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,770
I mean, we'll lose the deposit, but...

122
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,506
Mm, or you could just lie
to Captain Holt.

123
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:35,277
That's my policy for everything
and it always works.

124
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,645
I'm not gonna lie.

125
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:39,981
I'll just tell the Captain I made
a mistake, and he'll understand.

126
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,182
Mm-kay.

127
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:43,985
But if you do lie, you can't go
wrong with dental emergency.

128
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:45,820
Or death of a triplet.

129
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,622
Now that one you can use twice.

130
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,357
Smart.

131
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:50,792
Good news, sergeant.

132
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,168
I figured out what we're
gonna work on this weekend.

133
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,430
I'm working on spending time
with my family.

134
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:57,332
We're having a fancy tea party.

135
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,034
I am the King of origami napkins.

136
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,302
Oh, that's nice.

137
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,636
I thought you were taking
the weekend off.

138
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,472
No, I decided to spend the weekend
taking things to the next level.

139
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:05,847
Work-wise.

140
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,909
I found a cold case of ours
that everyone foolishly said

141
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,978
was unsolvable.

142
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:12,614
Case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ.

143
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:15,750
Jake, case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ
<i>is</i> unsolvable.

144
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:21,623
Or maybe case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is
waiting for someone to de-unsolve it.

145
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,492
What's case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ?

146
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:27,529
Case 52ABX... we gotta find a way
to abbreviate this thing.

147
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,598
Anyway, it's an old case
that the sarge and I worked

148
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:30,966
about eight years ago.

149
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,134
This guy Nate Dexter was
murdered in a boat explosion.

150
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,670
No witnesses, no leads,
minimal evidence.

151
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,072
This case almost killed us.

152
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:38,306
Yeah, but I'm on a hot streak!

153
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,275
Plus we're better detectives now.

154
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:43,912
We're smarter, computers are
faster, no more blockbuster.

155
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:45,881
Drones?

156
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:48,216
I'm feeling it.

157
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,218
That was creepy.
Huh?

158
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,686
But... convincing.

159
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,321
Oh, he's standing up.

160
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:54,890
I've always wanted to solve that case.

161
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,892
Then think about how good
it would feel to finally do it.

162
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,026
What's the best moment of your life?

163
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,694
My wedding day.

164
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,329
Tied with the day my babies were born.

165
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:04,900
Compared to this,
those memories will be garbage.

166
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,668
You don't know what you're saying.

167
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:08,837
'Cause I'm not married
and I don't have kids. Right?

168
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,453
Okay.

169
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:12,670
Okay, here's what we know.

170
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,573
Nate Dexter was a small-time
crook who pissed someone off.

171
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,074
They blew up his boat,
with him still on it,

172
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,743
and left no evidence
except this one charred finger

173
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,345
and Nate's melted torso.

174
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,080
Man, I'm having deja vu right now.

175
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,916
Whoever did it left no evidence,
<i>except one charred finger</i>

176
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,185
and Nate's melted torso.

177
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,621
So in other words nothing's changed.

178
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,822
Except our attitudes.

179
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,258
So! We start at the last place

180
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,893
that Dexter was seen
before he went to the marina...

181
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,428
His apartment.

182
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,498
I'm telling you, sarge,
I got a good feeling about this.

183
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,834
Aw, no!

184
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,136
Well, it appears
his building was torn down.

185
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,273
I know this seems like bad
news, but on the plus side

186
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,276
the harder the solve
the sweeter the solve.

187
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,711
No, it's just bad news.

188
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,778
You're bad news.

189
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,146
What?
What?

190
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,549
Just saying
you're bad news for bad guys,

191
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,785
'cause you're a number-one cop.

192
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,821
Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!

193
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,222
What?
What?

194
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,790
Let's solve the case!

195
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,526
<i>Hey!</i>

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,161
We need to tell Charles about Babylon.

197
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,196
He needs a private place
to talk to Vivian.

198
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:15,332
What? No!
Babylon's our secret place.

199
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,736
It's the best thing in my life,
and I have a very full life.

200
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,839
Do you know I know Papa John?
<i>The</i> Papa John.

201
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,073
Someone is lying to you.

202
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,308
<i>We can't tell Charles.</i>

203
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,343
He's incapable of keeping a secret.

204
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,845
I shouldn't tell you this,

205
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:31,248
but we're throwing you
a surprise party later!

206
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,250
Look, we tell Charles about Babylon,

207
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,286
or I shred your nap blanket
into a million tiny rags.

208
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,589
No! I love wolfie.
Fine! You win!

209
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,391
Tell Charles.

210
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,393
Hold me close, little wolfie.

211
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,794
Hold me.

212
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,197
All right, convict.

213
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,732
What do you know
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

214
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,901
Look, I'll tell you the same thing...

215
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,389
I told you eight years ago.

216
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,104
I don't know anything about Nate Dexter.

217
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,272
And even if I did...

218
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,041
The best French toast I ever ate

219
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,843
was with mayor Lindsay's dog.

220
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:02,313
He's very old, he's lost his mind.

221
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,069
We're making progress!

222
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:08,385
Hello, Captain, my old friend.

223
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:09,920
I've come to talk with you...

224
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,222
Again.

225
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,590
I've lapsed into song lyrics.

226
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,858
Santiago, can I help you?

227
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,494
I need to speak with you
about this weekend.

228
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:17,995
Ah, yes, I'm so happy you'll be there

229
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,763
to oversee
the audio-visual presentation.

230
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,366
The last time did not...
Go well.

231
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,168
The next chart shows
the drop in the crime rate

232
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,737
over the last month.

233
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,176
I just erased everything.

234
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:36,247
I'm so sorry, but I think I'm gonna
be unable to help out tomorrow.

235
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,415
Why is that?

236
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,917
Dental emergency.

237
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.

238
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,421
Wow, you must be in a lotta pain.

239
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,357
Yeah, I've been in pain for days.

240
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,192
I had no idea you were living like this.

241
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,293
No one knows.

242
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,896
I am a rock.
I am an island.

243
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,898
I have lapsed into song lyrics again.

244
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,232
Okay.

245
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,068
That's all of 'em.

246
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,137
What? What about to Frank Williams?

247
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,405
He's in the infirmary.

248
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:04,275
He was beat up pretty good,
a lot of internal bleeding.

249
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,676
Awesome!

250
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,211
I mean, not the internal bleeding thing.

251
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,546
That sounds horrifying.

252
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,880
But I bet you we can get him to talk

253
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,382
if we offer to move him
from his current address

254
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,817
on beatdown boulevard.

255
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,619
That's a great idea.
Looks like we got lucky.

256
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:16,954
<i>Hey, side note...</i>

257
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,155
"Beatdown boulevard,"

258
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,557
good name for my debut hip-hop record.

259
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,659
Strongly disagree.
Okay.

260
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,894
Will you just tell me
where we're going?

261
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:26,831
Guys? Guys!

262
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,966
Oh, my God, you're gonna beat me up.

263
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,938
Welcome to Babylon!

264
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,073
<i>It's our secret bathroom.</i>

265
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,908
It's so beautiful.

266
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,777
There used to be a transit
police squad down here.

267
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,646
This was a Captain's bathroom.
I found it a while back.

268
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,482
She told me about it a year ago

269
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,050
when I got stomach flu
from that sewer rave.

270
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,685
Fun night though.

271
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,187
<i>We put a lotta effort
into making this place nice.</i>

272
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,755
Look.

273
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,990
Weird crystals.

274
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,593
Also, lavender-scented candles,

275
00:09:55,627 --> 00:10:00,131
a zebra-skin rug, and the toilet
paper is, mm, triple-ply.

276
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,398
Wow.

277
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,234
It turns anyone's bottom into a VIP.

278
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,502
More importantly...

279
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,870
<i>It has great cell service.</i>

280
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:08,506
We thought you could use this place
to call Vivian when you need to.

281
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,475
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone about this.

282
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,010
I pinky promise.

283
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,012
Not good enough.

284
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,047
Blood pact!
Ahh!

285
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,849
All right, Frank, let's recap, shall we?

286
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,552
You slipped and fell onto a shiv.

287
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:24,789
Then you got up and fell
backwards onto another shiv.

288
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,526
And finally one last shiv fell from
the ceiling and into your body.

289
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

290
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,228
I think you got shivved.

291
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,630
What do you guys want?

292
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,831
We wanna make a deal.

293
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,733
You know anything
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

294
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,867
<i>Maybe.</i>

295
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,836
What do I get if I do?

296
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,337
How about a transfer
to another cell block?

297
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,806
One with fewer shivs.

298
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,007
<i>Okay.</i>

299
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,942
I can't be sure,

300
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:48,179
but I think Dexter owed money
to a guy named Sam Bunsen.

301
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,047
And... that's a new lead!

302
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,149
First lead in eight years.

303
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,417
You were right.

304
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,886
* Ohhh, beatdown boulevard *

305
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,254
* Is the toughest street in town *

306
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:58,389
No, no.

307
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,391
* And if you step to a gangsta crew *

308
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,926
* You're bound to get beat down *

309
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,027
* Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha *

310
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,029
Santiago.
How are your teeth feeling?

311
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:06,564
<i>Oh.</i>

312
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,832
Dental emergency?

313
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes, it just sorta happened.

314
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,204
It still hurts, but I can
make it till tomorrow.

315
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,773
Well, if you're in this much pain,
I don't think you should wait.

316
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,074
My brother-in-law is
one of the top oral surgeons

317
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,209
in the quint-state area.

318
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,578
That's two better
than the tri-state area.

319
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,046
He's agreed to see you tonight at 6:00

320
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,115
as a personal favor to me and Kevin.

321
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,383
Wow! Tonight!

322
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,885
<i>Thank you.</i>

323
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,554
But that's not gonna work...

324
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,256
Because of the anesthesia

325
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,691
<i>and driving myself home.</i>

326
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:36,026
I'll just go tomorrow.
Teddy can take me.

327
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,528
Nonsense.

328
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,131
I'll drive you to and from
the dentist's office myself.

329
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,668
That's great, just great.

330
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,237
<i>He's a good dude.</i>

331
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,939
He's a good, good dude.

332
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,574
Hey, sarge.

333
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,676
No sign of Sam Bunsen
in the federal database.

334
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,311
You got anything?
Bad news.

335
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,981
I only found his wife and she hasn't
heard from him in eight years.

336
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,716
That doesn't sound good.
<i>Yeah.</i>

337
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,985
That's why I started
by saying "bad news."

338
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,320
Terry believes in having
a clear topic sentence.

339
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,157
I bet Mrs. Bunsen is lying.
She knows where her husband is.

340
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,892
I pushed pretty hard.

341
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,593
She said she's willing
to take a lie detector test.

342
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,429
Well, then let's bust out the polygraph.

343
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,230
Lie detector truth or dare!

344
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,632
No. Boyle, last time we did that,

345
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,400
you ended up telling everyone
you had a crush on the teapot

346
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,802
from<i> Beauty and the Beast.</i>

347
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,737
It's the way they drew her.

348
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,687
All right, pretty boy, where is it?

349
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,288
Where's what?

350
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:28,322
The secret bathroom.

351
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:31,126
Secret what?
Bathroom where?

352
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,560
Okay, Captain, I'll be right there!

353
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:34,429
Don't lie to us.

354
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,031
We've been watching you.

355
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:40,568
11:18 A.M., Rosa told you to follow
her, and you guys left together.

356
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,139
You returned at 11:31
smelling of lavender.

357
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,643
And you've been drinking
chamomile tea all day long

358
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,578
and haven't been to the men's room once.

359
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:53,148
Since when are you two
so into being good detectives?

360
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:54,716
Since it came to secret bathrooms.

361
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,184
Tell us where it is!

362
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:57,986
<i>Now!</i>

363
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,555
Okay! Please state
your name one more time.

364
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,424
Are we really doing this again?

365
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:03,825
It's, like, the fifth time.

366
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,328
That's a lie!
It's only the fourth time!

367
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,662
<i>No?</i>

368
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,364
Okay, my bad.
Continue.

369
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:13,802
I'm Sophia Bunsen, I haven't talked
to my husband in eight years.

370
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:17,105
This is Nate Dexter.
He was friends with my husband.

371
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,074
I didn't know he was dead.

372
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:23,078
You think my husband killed him,
but I guarantee that's impossible.

373
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,914
Okay.
Good.

374
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,949
But not good enough!
Let's do it again.

375
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,618
<i>Jake, what's going on with you?</i>

376
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:31,219
She passed the test like five times.

377
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:33,822
Or maybe...
She's in cahoots.

378
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,890
With him! Hmm?

379
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,192
Are you two cahooting?

380
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:38,493
Are you cahooting?

381
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,061
Jake!
It's over, man.

382
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:41,429
<i>We had a lead, now it's dead.</i>

383
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,265
It happens!
No.

384
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,833
If it's not her, and it's not him...

385
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,801
Which I'm still not
convinced of, by the way,

386
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,303
then it's gotta be the machine.

387
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:49,704
Strap me in, sergeant.

388
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:52,641
I'm taking this thing
for a test drive of truth.

389
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,143
Thanks for taking us, Marty.

390
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,711
Please, Ray, we're family.

391
00:13:58,781 --> 00:13:59,981
Neither of us can understand you at all.

392
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,416
Ah.

393
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,085
The visual examination
doesn't show much inflammation,

394
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,354
but these x-rays should be more telling.

395
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,690
Let's see what's beneath the surface.

396
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,891
Oh, stop!

397
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:11,426
Santiago.

398
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,161
I...

399
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,896
Oh, God.

400
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,932
I forgot I promised to help you,

401
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,334
and I made plans to go to the
Berkshires with my boyfriend.

402
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,368
Oh.

403
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,671
Wait.

404
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:26,508
So you lied to me to get out of work?

405
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:27,742
Yes.

406
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:30,879
I may be a liar, but
I've got great teeth.

407
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,814
And no one can take that from me.

408
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,183
Have you heard of "over-brushing?"

409
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,351
Oh, no.

410
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,053
Your aggressive technique
has stripped away

411
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:40,989
the protective enamel
and much of your gum.

412
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:43,692
You have seven cavities.

413
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:47,662
I have to say...
I feel like you deserve this.

414
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:49,998
Charles!

415
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,466
What the hell is wrong with you?

416
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,968
You told Hitchcock and Scully?

417
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,437
No! What?

418
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:58,206
Yep, this... is... happening.

419
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,674
They were scary.

420
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,309
It was like that moment
in <i>Planet of Apes</i>

421
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,544
when the monkey talked.

422
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,279
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>

423
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,713
You let me into your special place.

424
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,149
Ew.
I messed up, and I'll fix it.

425
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,484
It's okay, Charles, you don't have to.

426
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:13,021
No! It's not okay.
Babylon hath fallen.

427
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:15,857
Charles betrayed us
and I will make him pay for it.

428
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,958
<i>Gina, enough.</i>

429
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:18,727
Boyle needed a bathroom,
so we told him about it.

430
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:20,662
Just like I told you when you needed it?

431
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:22,130
Leave him alone.
He saved my life.

432
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:23,665
<i>Plus... he's pitiful.</i>

433
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,033
And his life is crap right now.

434
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,837
Yeah! It is!
Thank you, Rosa.

435
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,072
I'm telling you this machine is broken.

436
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,407
Ask me a question.

437
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,376
Is Jay Z really your favorite artist?

438
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,543
Yes, obviously.

439
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,312
Lie.

440
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,114
See? It's busted.
Is it?

441
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,249
Or is your favorite artist
really Taylor Swift?

442
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,351
No.

443
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:44,853
Lie.
All right, fine.

444
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:46,721
She is.

445
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,256
She makes me feel things.

446
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,959
She makes me all of us feel things!

447
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,895
Look, that machine is working just fine.

448
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:55,997
Why are you being so crazy
about this case?

449
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,933
I wanted to work
the toughest case we had.

450
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,401
Why?

451
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:00,735
Because it would feel
awesome to solve it.

452
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:02,504
Because a real man
doesn't run from a challenge.

453
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,773
I mean, do they run
from the bulls in Pamplona?

454
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,841
Yeah. That's the whole point of it.

455
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,110
Seriously?
That seems lame.

456
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:11,379
I don't know why you wanna spend
the entire weekend at work,

457
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,714
but I'm going home to my family.

458
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,716
See you tomorrow, Jake.

459
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,585
Fine, abandon me!

460
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't want you here anyway.

461
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,588
That's a lie.

462
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,523
Come on, man.

463
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,193
I got here an hour early.
This better be good.

464
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:27,128
Hmm?
Holy Moses!

465
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,530
What happened to you?

466
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:31,700
<i>I have not slept in, since I
last saw you,</i> many hours.

467
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,201
Plus, I think I'm hallucinating

468
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,937
because I'm pretty sure I just
heard your biceps mocking me.

469
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,639
No, that's possible.

470
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,808
My biceps mock a lotta people.
<i>Mm.</i>

471
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,042
Good to know.

472
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,579
So I rewatched the
interrogation, and get this.

473
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,481
Sophia wasn't lying about anything.

474
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:48,149
She doesn't know who killed Nate Dexter.

475
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,220
But... she does know
something way better.

476
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,957
Come with me.

477
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:58,727
Jake!
Hmm?

478
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,128
People normally move
after they say that.

479
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,497
Oh, yeah, I feel asleep for a second.

480
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,232
Sorry.

481
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,001
Come with me.

482
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,782
Okay! Ahh!

483
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,404
Y'all ready for this?
You know what I'm saying?

484
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,941
Terry Jeffords,
allow me to introduce to you...

485
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:19,378
Our murder victim,
the not-dead Nate Dexter.

486
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,047
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

487
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,015
Right?

488
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,383
Sophia wasn't lying.

489
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,952
I was just not asking
the right questions.

490
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,666
She hadn't seen her husband
in eight years,

491
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,456
but she was positive there's
no way that he killed Dexter.

492
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:33,459
That's when it occurred to me,
no one killed him.

493
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,962
Hey, Nate, just talking
about how you're alive.

494
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:38,030
Yeah, I'm alive.

495
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,032
But whose melted torso did we find?

496
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:43,903
Sophia's husband.

497
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,104
Yes!

498
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,173
Sophia and Dexter were having an affair,

499
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:49,642
husband found out, Nate killed him.

500
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:51,644
Now I'm telling my friend
about how you killed that guy.

501
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:53,179
It was for love!

502
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,780
Cool motive, still a murder.

503
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,782
Also, you remember that severed finger?

504
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,351
Check this out.
Hey, Nate.

505
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,753
<i>Show us your hands, please?</i>

506
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:02,788
<i>Ho-ho!
Right?</i>

507
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,558
Cut it off himself.
How screwed up is that?

508
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,960
Anyway, I asked all of my CIs
if they had dealings

509
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,295
with a nine-fingered man.

510
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,831
Unsolvable case...
Solved!

511
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,032
Whoo!

512
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,735
What'd you wanna talk to us about?

513
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,436
Well, I got Hitchcock and Scully

514
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,605
to promise never to use
our bathroom again.

515
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,040
How'd you do that?

516
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,442
The Donald and I call it
"the art of the deal."

517
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,144
You want your bathroom back, fine.

518
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,879
I want your chair.
Mine smells like my butt.

519
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:27,914
Ew! Fine.

520
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:29,382
And we want your coyote blanket.

521
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,083
It's not a coyote, it's a wolf.

522
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,785
Learn your animals, idiot.

523
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,053
Told you she wasn't serious.

524
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,621
Let's go, Scully.

525
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,856
Fine!

526
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,457
I can't believe you gave up wolfie.

527
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,559
<i>It was worth it.</i>

528
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:42,228
Plus, I'm done with wolves now.

529
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,930
I'm into angry unicorns.

530
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:48,201
If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.

531
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,735
Jake!

532
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,304
Nice job on the case.
Great solve!

533
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,472
Thanks. Aren't you supposed
to be in the Berkshires?

534
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,274
I had a dental thing.

535
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,409
But you're such a good brusher.

536
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,777
I know!

537
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,178
Turns out that was my undoing.

538
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,847
Classic.
Yeah.

539
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,215
Hey, you remember Teddy.

540
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,549
Oh! Yeah. Hey, man.
How are you?

541
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,851
<i>Great solve.</i>

542
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,619
Can I buy you a Pilsner?
They have awesome Pilsners here.

543
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,987
Teddy's really into Pilsners.

544
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,222
Cool!

545
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:10,523
Attention!

546
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,328
Everyone raise your glasses
to the amazing Jake Peralta!

547
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,730
<i>Today, he did the impossible.</i>

548
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:21,334
He closed case 52abx-dash-32qj.

549
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,937
Speech, speech, speech!

550
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,173
Look, the real hero here
is the murderer.

551
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,774
Because without him
there wouldn't be a case.

552
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:32,011
So... here's to Nate Dexter,
the murderer.

553
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,720
Captain... I wanna
apologize for lying.

554
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:43,022
Thank you.

555
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:44,724
Next time just talk to me.

556
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay.

557
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:50,596
Now I know this comes
on the heels of betraying you,

558
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:52,765
but... can I have next weekend off

559
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:54,901
to go to that cabin
in the Berkshires with Teddy?

560
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,307
Okay.

561
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,076
Thank you, sir.

562
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:11,184
I still can't feel my mouth.
Did a little bit dribble out?

563
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,553
What's going on with you?

564
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,021
For the past two days,

565
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,722
you've been telling me
how amazing it was gonna be

566
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:18,090
to solve this case.

567
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,892
This does not look amazing.

568
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,160
I don't know, man.

569
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,095
I thought I'd be more psyched too.

570
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,331
Maybe I just need a cooler case.
No.

571
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,700
That is not gonna work.

572
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,936
You set the precinct record,
you weren't happy.

573
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,239
You solved an unsolvable case,
you weren't happy.

574
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,907
No case is gonna make you happy.

575
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:37,643
Something's bothering you.

576
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:41,013
And whatever it is
you gotta deal with it.

577
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:44,617
Yeah, well, maybe I can't
deal with it right now, or...

578
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,085
You know, whatever.

579
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,056
I know!

580
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:51,691
Oh.

581
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:52,925
That's a tough one.

582
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,660
Yeah.

583
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:57,396
But solving more cases isn't
gonna make you feel any better.

584
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,701
Having a drink
with a friend might though.

585
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:05,905
Thank you, but I don't think
another drink is gonna help.

586
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:07,673
I think having a lot more drinks
might help.

587
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,309
There he is!

588
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:14,780
So...
Amy, huh?

589
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:16,415
We're gonna need some shots.

590
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,084
* What a man, what a man *

591
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,453
* What a man, what a mighty good man *

592
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,188
Everybody comes around!

593
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:23,623
* What a man, what a man *

594
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,725
* What a man, what a mighty good man *

595
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,493
I hate myself right now.

596
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:31,531

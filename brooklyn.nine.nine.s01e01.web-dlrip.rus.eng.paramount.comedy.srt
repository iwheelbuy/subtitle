1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:03,163
This job is eating me alive.

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,399
I can't breathe anymore.

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,968
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy,

4
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,537
the man in the white hat.

5
00:00:10,572 --> 00:00:13,207
I'm not becoming like them.

6
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,642
I am them.

7
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:18,345
Hey! What are
you doing, weirdo?

8
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:20,180
I'm doing the best speech
from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

9
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:21,982
Or actually,

10
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,384
ten of me are doing the best
speech from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

11
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,286
What's up?

12
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,522
Get it together, man.
Okay?

13
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:30,257
<i>So the store was hit
about two hours ago.</i>

14
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,759
<i>They took mostly tablets,
laptops, and cameras.</i>

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,564
Sorry.

16
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,040
I'd like a list
of all your employees,

17
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,102
whoever had access
to the store.

18
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:44,137
I'd also like to apologize
for my partner.

19
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:45,939
His parents didn't give him
enough attention.

20
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:47,007
Uh, Detective...

21
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,609
<i>I already solved the case.</i>

22
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,143
We're looking
for three white males,

23
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:51,845
one of whom has sleeve tats
on both arms.

24
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:53,580
And how do you know that?

25
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,482
I had an informant
on the inside.

26
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:57,084
He's been here for years.

27
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:59,987
Watching, learning.
Waiting.

28
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,356
His code name?

29
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:04,524
Fuzzy Cuddle bear.

30
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,426
He's a nanny cam.

31
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,228
You got lucky.

32
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,997
No, I got here five minutes
before you

33
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,665
and figured that in
this gigantic electronics store,

34
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,634
there had to be at least
one working camera.

35
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,769
Oh! Hi, bad guys!

36
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,138
<i>You did it, fuzzy.
You busted 'em.</i>

37
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,007
It's time to come home.

38
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,875
I'm not sure
if I can.

39
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:24,978
I've been undercover so long,
I've forgotten who I am.

40
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,980
I have seen terrible things.

41
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:29,349
I haven't known the touch
of a woman in many moons.

42
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,984
All right.

43
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:33,553
Detective Santiago!

44
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,289
Don't walk away from me!

45
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:44,912

46
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,769
<i>Yes, I did crack the case.</i>

47
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,871
So, Santiago,
would you do the honors?

48
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:56,209
Ohhh!

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,644
I hate this!

50
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,912
<i>Ah, yeah.</i>

51
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:00,347
I hate this.

52
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:01,515
<i>And you're just
gonna add one.</i>

53
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,883
<i>I'm winning.</i>

54
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,686
<i>It's a good feeling.</i>

55
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,621
It's a good feeling.
Yeah.

56
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:08,822
Enjoy it while it lasts.

57
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,223
I will!

58
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,559
JP, update
on the Morgenthau murder?

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,262
Yeah! Good news
for all you murder fans.

60
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:17,064
Earlier this morning...

61
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,399
Someone decided
to shoot and kill

62
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,868
luxury food importer
Henry Morgenthau.

63
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,904
Body was found
by the cleaning lady,

64
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,606
during her interview, I deduced,
using expert Detective work,

65
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,742
that she had something
super gross on her chin.

66
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:32,346
I think it was flan.

67
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,613
Charles thinks it was flan.

68
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:35,148
I think
it was butterscotch pudding.

69
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,783
Maybe it was just
old person gunk.

70
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,318
You know how old people
always have that gunk on them.

71
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:39,586
Oldie gunk.
Could be, yeah.

72
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:40,887
Anyone else?

73
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:42,389
How about we focus
on the murder

74
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,358
and not the old person gunk?

75
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:45,692
Crime techs are
at the scene now.

76
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:46,860
We're heading back
when they're done.

77
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:48,395
Okay, I want you on this.

78
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:49,830
It's gonna be priority one
for the new C.O.

79
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:51,665
Wait, tell us
about the new Captain.

80
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,899
Captain Holt
will be here soon.

81
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,204
He'll wanna introduce himself.
Dismissed.

82
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:00,680
Hey, Gina.

83
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,376
You know any scalpers?

84
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,277
I wanna ask Rosa to go to
the Rihanna concert with me,

85
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:05,445
but it's sold out.

86
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,414
Okay,
two points to make here.

87
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:09,116
First, Rihanna...

88
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,283
You...

89
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,219
And then Rihanna.

90
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,421
Yeah.
What's your second point?

91
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,789
She's got a type.

92
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,891
Which is really anyone
but you.

93
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:20,394
Yeah, that was
my ex-wife's type too.

94
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:24,131
Look, a Rihanna concert's
a pretty big swing, man.

95
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:27,234
- I don't know.
- She's into watching old movies.

96
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,637
Cool. Where would I find a place
that shows old movies?

97
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,672
Oh, yeah, just go
on the Internet

98
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:36,243
and search for the phrase
"I want to buy two movie tickets

99
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:37,911
for a girl
who doesn't like me."

100
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,547
- Great. Thank you.
- Good.

101
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:44,418
Hey, you heard anything
about the new Captain?

102
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:46,353
Uh, no, and I don't care.

103
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:48,588
I just wish Captain McGintley
never left, he was the best.

104
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,123
He was terrible.

105
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:51,358
You just liked him
'cause he let you do

106
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,659
anything you wanted.

107
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,495
On your marks, get set...

108
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,997
<i>Go.</i>

109
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:58,665
What the hell's going on
around here?

110
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,967
Fire extinguisher
roller chair derby?

111
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,803
Okay.

112
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,438
And go!

113
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,943
Yeah!

114
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:11,945
What's your point?

115
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:14,114
If I'm ever gonna make Captain,
I need a good mentor.

116
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:15,148
I need my rabbi.

117
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,950
Sorry, dude...

118
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:18,752
But this new guy's gonna be
another washed-up pencil pusher

119
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,886
who's only concerned with...

120
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:21,188
Following every rule

121
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,156
in the patrol guide.

122
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:27,094
Meep morp zeep.
Robot Captain Engage.

123
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:29,129
- Is that what you think?
- He-hey!

124
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,698
New Captain alert.

125
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,400
You must be the new C.O.

126
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,535
I'm Detective Jake Peralta.
Great to meet you.

127
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,204
Now don't let me interrupt.

128
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,505
You were describing what
kind of person I'm gonna be.

129
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,840
I'd like you to finish.

130
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:43,577
That's not necessary.

131
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,613
Or I could recap
very quickly, sure.

132
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,415
Um, let's see.

133
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,083
I think I said some joke

134
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,052
about being
a washed-up pencil pusher.

135
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,887
- Now do the robot voice.
- Which...

136
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,989
The robot voice
you were doing

137
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,858
when you implied
I'm a rule-following robot.

138
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,861
I wanna hear it again.

139
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,233
Meep morp... zarp.

140
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:08,335
Robot.

141
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,670
- That's a terrible robot voice.
- Yep.

142
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,005
The next time I see you,

143
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,207
I'd like you
to be wearing a necktie.

144
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:17,244
Oh, actually, the last Captain
didn't care if we wore ties.

145
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:18,578
Well, your new Captain does.

146
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,946
And more importantly,

147
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,015
he cares that you follow
his direct orders.

148
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:23,216
Everyone,

149
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,651
I'm your new
commanding officer,

150
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:27,053
- Captain Ray Holt.
- Speech!

151
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:29,756
- That was my speech.
- Short and sweet.

152
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,760
- Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:36,596
I love that guy.

154
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:37,764
Same!

155
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,566
He's so suave.

156
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:43,103
Does anyone get
a little bit of a gay vibe?

157
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,871
No? Okay.

158
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:47,472
Sergeant, you were
in the 1-8 with me...

159
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:50,911
Though you were
significantly...

160
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:52,078
Fatter, sir.

161
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:53,980
They called me
"Terry Titties."

162
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,917
Because I had large, uh...

163
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,652
Titties, yes.
I remember.

164
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,220
I never liked
that nickname.

165
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,289
Though to be fair,
it was accurate.

166
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,457
What's this I hear about you
being on administrative leave?

167
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:09,229
A year ago, my wife and I
had twin baby girls.

168
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,031
Cagney and Lacey.

169
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:12,866
They have adorable
chubby cheeks.

170
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,769
Ever since, I kinda got
scared of getting hurt.

171
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,938
Lost my edge.

172
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,440
There was an incident
in a department store.

173
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,882
Hey, man, you okay?
You look a little jumpy.

174
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,110
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

175
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:28,315
Ahhh!

176
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:33,286
I think he's dead.

177
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,422
And I'm still not right.

178
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:37,657
Tell me about
your Detective squad.

179
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,360
Um...

180
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,495
Well, Scully, Hitchcock,
and Daniels.

181
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:43,830
<i>They're pretty much
worthless,</i>

182
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:45,198
but they make good coffee.

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,033
Copy that.

184
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,835
Now the good ones.

185
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,003
Rosa Diaz.

186
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:54,140
<i>Tough, smart, hard to read,
and really scary.</i>

187
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,410
Tell me who has me
for secret santa.

188
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:00,847
No! That takes all the fun
out of it.

189
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,416
It's Scully.
He got you a scarf.

190
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,987
- I'll make him return it.
- Yes, you will.

191
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:09,155
Charles Boyle.
He's a grinder.

192
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,790
<i>Not the most brilliant
Detective,</i>

193
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,459
<i>but he works harder
than anyone else.</i>

194
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,352
He's not physically gifted.

195
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:19,132
Oh, man!
My muffin.

196
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,634
Ahh!

197
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:22,902
Oh, my head!
My muffin, my head!

198
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,904
And I stepped on the...
On my muffin!

199
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,072
And my head and my muffin.

200
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:29,109
<i>Amy Santiago.</i>

201
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:30,844
She's got seven brothers,

202
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,178
so she's always trying
to prove she's tough.

203
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,447
Careful.
That stuff's pretty hot.

204
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:37,017
Oh, is it? Hmm?

205
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,162
<i>She and Peralta
have some big bet</i>

206
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:50,830
<i>over who gets
more arrests this year.</i>

207
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:53,867
Ever since the bet,
their numbers have gone way up.

208
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,402
Tell me about Peralta.

209
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:58,405
<i>Jacob Peralta
is my best Detective.</i>

210
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,974
He likes putting away bad guys
and he loves solving puzzles.

211
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,343
The only puzzle
he hasn't solved

212
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,478
is how to grow up.

213
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:07,647
That was very well put.

214
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,917
I've talked a lot about Jake
in my departmentally mandated

215
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,652
therapy sessions.

216
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,354
Look, you know my history.

217
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,755
You know how important
this is to me.

218
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,257
This precinct is doing fine,

219
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:19,726
but I wanna make it
the best one in Brooklyn.

220
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:20,827
And I need your help.

221
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,293
Absolutely, sir.

222
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,998
Where do we start?

223
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,507
* What is happening?

224
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,134
We start with him.

225
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,036
Okay, so the perp came in
through the window,

226
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,538
<i>left the muddy red footprint,</i>

227
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:37,406
<i>and apparently had sex
with the dish rack.</i>

228
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,542
Shell casing found here.
Two shots.

229
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,843
Bang, bang.

230
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,712
Great work, Detective.

231
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:44,313
You get a tie.

232
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:45,715
Hey, that's mine.
You took it from my desk.

233
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:46,818
That's right, Charles.
Good solve.

234
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,150
- Tie for you.
- Thanks!

235
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,652
Now everyone be sure
to put those on

236
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,053
because it's impossible
to solve crimes

237
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:53,823
- unless you're wearing a tie.
- Lay off the Captain.

238
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,524
That man is gonna be
my rabbi.

239
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,226
Okay, first of all,
when you use the word "rabbi,"

240
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,728
you know that turns me on

241
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,062
and that's unfair
in the work environment.

242
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,665
Secondly, your rabbi
is a pain in my ass.

243
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,400
Yeah, he's a little
too serious.

244
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,901
- What do you think, Rosa?
- He seems cool.

245
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,536
Yeah, he seems cool.
I agree.

246
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:10,372
Looks like the perp stole
a computer, a watch,

247
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:14,043
and a Jamon Iberico ham,
valued at... what!

248
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,611
$6,000.

249
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:17,613
$6,000 for a ham?

250
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:21,117
Jamon Iberico is an amazing
cured ham from Spain.

251
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,718
They had it
at my uncle's funeral.

252
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,054
I gorged myself
at that funeral.

253
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,722
I mean, I was constipated
for three days.

254
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:29,091
Wow, that's a great story,
Charles, thank you.

255
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:30,926
<i>All right,
listen up, everybody.</i>

256
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,328
Better contact Captain Holt,

257
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,629
let him know
we got a ten-tie situation.

258
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,565
Speaking of ties,
where's yours, meep morp?

259
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,800
This is fantastic.

260
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,468
Captain!
Hey!

261
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,837
Welcome to the murder.
What are you doing here?

262
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,239
I like to know
what my detectives are up to.

263
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,074
- That okay by you?
- Yep.

264
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,542
Take Santiago
and knock on doors.

265
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,943
See if the neighbors
heard anything.

266
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:49,378
Door duty?
It's a waste of time.

267
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,213
Diaz and Boyle.
Check in the coroner.

268
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:54,049
<i>Report back to me
in an hour.</i>

269
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,919
- That went well.
<i>- No, it didn't.</i>

270
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,588
He's got like super hearing.

271
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:01,490
Hey, Rosa!
Rosa. Rosa!

272
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:05,227
Um, I just happened
to notice

273
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:06,896
that there's
an old movie festival

274
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,832
playing at the film forum
this week.

275
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,400
Wanna go?

276
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:12,635
Sure.

277
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,470
Cool! Awesome.

278
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:16,272
<i>There's a bunch
of movie options.</i>

279
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:19,475
<i>I'll probably just go
with something classic</i>

280
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:21,143
like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

281
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:23,078
<i>Citizen Kane</i> is terrible.
Pick a good movie.

282
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,614
<i>Good call. Smart.</i>

283
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,116
<i>I'll do it.</i>

284
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,753
I'll pick a better movie
than <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

285
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,454
<i>So Gina...</i>

286
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,490
Civilian administrators
like yourself

287
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,292
often have their ear
to the ground.

288
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,827
What do Santiago and Peralta

289
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:39,228
have riding
on this bet of theirs?

290
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:41,831
I will tell you
on six conditions.

291
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,866
<i>Number one, you let me
use your office</i>

292
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,367
to practice my dance moves.

293
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:46,502
Second...
How about this?

294
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,337
- If you tell me...
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,105
I won't
have you suspended...

296
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,240
Without pay.

297
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,675
Oh, that sounds great.

298
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,644
Okay, the deal is
if Amy gets more arrests,

299
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,613
Jake has to give her
his car.

300
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,882
It's an old Mustang,
and it's pretty sweet.

301
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,550
If he gets more arrests,

302
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,286
she has to go
on a date with him.

303
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,790
He guarantees
it will end in sex.

304
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:10,826
I bet on at least
some over-the-clothes action.

305
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,494
At the very least,
some touching...

306
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,863
- No, that's enough, Gina.
- Caresses.

307
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:16,131
I could see him showing up
in a silk robe.

308
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,233
- That's enough, Gina.
- All right.

309
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,701
Thank you.

310
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:21,136
<i>Let the wasting of time begin.</i>

311
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,807
Hello, sir.

312
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,175
Can we ask you
a few questions?

313
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,910
Definitely.
Yeah.

314
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,845
I'm actually... I'm super glad
you guys are here right now.

315
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,547
Are you smelling
that weed smell?

316
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:32,681
Yeah.

317
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,682
'Cause a dude broke in,

318
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,651
smoked weed,
and bolted.

319
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,019
It's...

320
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:38,520
Do you think
it's the same dude

321
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,256
that left that bong there
on the floor?

322
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,825
Yes.

323
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:46,028
Police!

324
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,197
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,331
What's your name?

326
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,599
- My name?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,401
- Mlepnos.
- Can you spell that, please?

328
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:57,239
M-l-e-p...

329
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,507
Clay.

330
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,675
Did you say "Clay"?

331
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:01,043
Yes, the "Clay" is silent.

332
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,778
All right, got it.

333
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,215
Have you seen this man before?
He was shot last night.

334
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:08,951
Oh. Thank you.

335
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,686
No, sir, that's ours.
We need that.

336
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,688
- We...
- And he kept it.

337
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,390
Wall Street journal
<i>on the doormat...</i>

338
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:15,891
Top floor apartment.

339
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,427
20 bucks says this guy's
like a hot, eligible bachelor.

340
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:19,695
I'll take that action.

341
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,631
Police! Open up!

342
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,600
Hello.

343
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,201
Oh! Hello, sir!

344
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,603
How are you today?

345
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,238
I am Detective
Right-All-The-Time,

346
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:32,541
and this is my partner
Detective Terrible Detective.

347
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:35,945
No surprises from the coroner.

348
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,646
A few gunshots,
shoulder and chest.

349
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,815
None of the neighbors heard
or saw anything.

350
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:43,052
And what's worse, Santiago
struck out with a 92-year-old.

351
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,386
That is not accurate, sir.

352
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,255
Wait, you hooked up
with him? Ugh!

353
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,057
All right, hit the pawn shops
and canvass the neighborhood.

354
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,491
And while you're out,
you can buy yourself a tie.

355
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:50,960
<i>Oh, actually, sir...</i>

356
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:52,928
I'm wearing a tie right now.

357
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,496
Check it out.

358
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,899
Secret tie.

359
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,267
First of all, I think
you're kind of overdoing it

360
00:12:58,268 --> 00:12:59,668
with the manscaping.

361
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,136
<i>But more importantly,
Detective,</i>

362
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:03,305
why do you refuse to
take my orders seriously?

363
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,107
Does anyone here know why
it's so important to me

364
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,743
that you all dress
appropriately?

365
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,997
<i>Hmm. Four highly trained
detectives</i>

366
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:12,348
<i>and not one of you
can solve this simple mystery.</i>

367
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:14,850
I wanna be briefed
on any new developments.

368
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,285
Any questions?

369
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:17,619
I was gonna ask you
if you thought I was doing

370
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,121
too much manscaping,
but we solved that one.

371
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,656
So I'm good.

372
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:21,991
<i>Hey, Boyle.</i>

373
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,759
- Yep.
- What about this fancy ham stuff?

374
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,327
- Jamon Iberico.
- Yes.

375
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:26,762
The perp left
a really expensive TV

376
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:29,164
but then stole ham?
It doesn't make sense.

377
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,667
Is there a place nearby
the crime scene that sells it?

378
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,635
- Beneficio's might.
- Let's go.

379
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:35,137
You gotta brief
the C.O. first.

380
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,040
We'll brief him
after we catch the guy.

381
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,177
My name is Ratko.
I don't know anything.

382
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:43,679
Oh, okay.

383
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,047
You recognize this guy?

384
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,450
- Henry Morgenthau?
- No.

385
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:51,020
Maybe actually look
at the picture.

386
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,055
I don't know him.
I don't know what happened.

387
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,656
No more questions.

388
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,458
Well, why don't I run
a scenario past you, Ratko,

389
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,793
and you tell me
what you think?

390
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,194
You do know Morgenthau.

391
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,462
He came in here and tried
to sell you some hams.

392
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,663
You knew they were worth
a lotta money,

393
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:02,798
so you tried to steal them
from him

394
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,966
when he wasn't home.

395
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,167
Only he was home,
so you shot him.

396
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,236
Does that sound familiar?

397
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,837
Uh, maybe some role play
will jog your memory?

398
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,005
- Great idea.
- Okay, yeah.

399
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay.

400
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,509
- So I'm... I'm Ratko.
- No, no, I'm Ratko.

401
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,077
Come on.
I'm always the victim.

402
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,712
Look, I'm doing this
with you right here.

403
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:17,880
Fine, fine.

404
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,715
Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau,

405
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:22,351
owner of delicious
and expensive hams.

406
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:23,852
Don't I know you
from the grocery store?

407
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:26,088
Kill!
And scene.

408
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:30,392
<i>NYPD! Everyone down!</i>

409
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,860
Ma'am, if you could
just get down,

410
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,662
or... ignore me
and continue shopping.

411
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:36,198
Boyle, get the door!
On it!

412
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,934
Ratko!

413
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,271
Oh!

414
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,407
Ow!

415
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,078
Ha ha ha!

416
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,983
<i>Ow, Ratko, ow!</i>

417
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,218
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Ratko!

418
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,286
I'm getting mad!

419
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,821
That's a waste of manchego!

420
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,189
Charles!

421
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,694
How are you still here?
<i>Jake!</i>

422
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,229
Little help!

423
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,164
Ratko! He's not going
anywhere, Jake!

424
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,532
Ratko!

425
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,034
I got him! I got him!

426
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,304
Don't worry!

427
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:18,207
So no, I did not brief you.

428
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,975
<i>And yes, he did get away.</i>

429
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,945
But some bonus good news...

430
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:25,214
I got you hazelnut.

431
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,549
And...

432
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,552
A little spoon
there for you.

433
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,167
Is he seriously
assigning me

434
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,669
to the records room?

435
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,504
I mean, why do we even have
a records room?

436
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,005
Computer's been invented, right?
I didn't dream it?

437
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,440
You're lucky, man.

438
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,943
I wish I could get
assigned here full-time.

439
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:46,646
You could not be farther
from the action.

440
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,848
Sergeant, you know me.
I have more arrests than anyone.

441
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,417
Will you please tell the Captain
how dumb it is

442
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:52,493
to lock his best Detective
in a file cabinet?

443
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,587
Second best.
You're wrong about Holt.

444
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,989
That man has forgotten more
about being a cop

445
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,158
than you will ever know.

446
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,494
In 1981, he caught
the disco strangler.

447
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,098
It's over, disco man!

448
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:08,001
Put down the yo-yo
and back away from the girl.

449
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:11,604
Wow.

450
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,941
The man is the real deal.
You need to listen to him.

451
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,609
Gonna be hard to win our bet

452
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,378
when you're
on the bench, Peralta.

453
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,781
Although I did start
a new category.

454
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,416
"Murderers we let go."

455
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,851
And look at that.

456
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:27,587
You're winning.

457
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,155
Have fun with your files.

458
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,623
Yeah, you know what,
I will have fun with my files.

459
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:34,294
Have fun with your face!

460
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,029
Slam!

461
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,831
That was a slam.

462
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:42,802
So what movie did you
get us tickets to?

463
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,237
Oh, well,
just to be safe,

464
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,539
I bought tickets
to all of them.

465
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,375
Just to be safe?
What does that mean?

466
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,144
I don't know,
I didn't wanna mess up.

467
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,880
Because you're sort of...
Opinionated.

468
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:56,016
You think I'm opinionated?
Okay, here's an opinion for you.

469
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,717
You're a bad judge
of character

470
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,853
and your shirt
looks like vomit.

471
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,122
So we can go see
<i>North by Northwest.</i>

472
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,289
We're not seeing
a movie together.

473
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:04,791
Good call.
Smart.

474
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,092
<i>Keep it profesh.</i>

475
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,905
- Hey, Captain.
- <i>So you found something?</i>

476
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,540
Hey, I like the tie.

477
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,942
If you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.

478
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,511
Anyway, I think
I got something good here.

479
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,513
Turns out the name "Ratko"
is made up.

480
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:28,114
But I was digging
through these files...

481
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,683
One of which I literally
found in a spider web...

482
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,218
And it turns out there were
a bunch of references

483
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,686
to a serbian thug,

484
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,522
street names "the rat"
and "the butcher,"

485
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,590
<i>who's known to hang out
at a storage unit</i>

486
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,627
near Boerum Park,
which has red soil,

487
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:44,497
hence, the muddy red footprint
on Morgenthau's counter.

488
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,108
That's fine work,
Detective.

489
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,035
Thank you very much, sir.

490
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,737
Testament to what
can be achieved

491
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,440
when you dress appropriately.

492
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,442
Let's pound it out.

493
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:01,648
You know what,
such fine police work,

494
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,683
let's share it
with the whole team.

495
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,219
<i>Santiago! Boyle! Diaz!
Get in here!</i>

496
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,921
Bring everyone!
And a camera!

497
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:11,309
That's not necessary.
Oh, they're here!

498
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,960
<i>Of the fine master Detective,
Jake Peralta.</i>

499
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:14,994
Yeah, let's have a hand,
everyone.

500
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,297
- Give him a hand.
- Yeah, nice!

501
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,766
Looking good!

502
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,234
Yeah.
Thank you.

503
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,169
No record of Ratko on the ledger.

504
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,704
Must've used cash.

505
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,573
Well, I, for one,
am just pumped

506
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,475
to be on a stakeout
with you, Captain.

507
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:30,743
You know what my favorite thing
about stakeouts is?

508
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,146
Patrol guide says
"no dress code."

509
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:36,683
So I'm just the zip-up hoodie
and my two best friends.

510
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:38,318
Does he always
talk this much?

511
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,752
I just tune it out.

512
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,221
It's like
a white noise machine.

513
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,323
Okay, first of all,
that's racist.

514
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,158
Secondly, Captain,

515
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,594
Terry told me
you caught the disco strangler.

516
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:50,163
That's incredible.
I've read that case.

517
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,998
With all due respect, sir,

518
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,868
why'd it take you so long
to get your first command?

519
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,169
Because I'm gay.

520
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,105
Ah.

521
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,040
Seriously?

522
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,675
I'm surprised
you didn't know.

523
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,945
I don't try to hide it.

524
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,220
Did anyone else get
a little bit of a gay vibe?

525
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,924
Manscaping.

526
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,226
Damn!

527
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,962
I am not a good Detective.

528
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,831
<i>Here.</i>

529
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,332
I feel bad that you spent all
that money on the movie tickets.

530
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,567
Why don't you just go
to the movies with me?

531
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,802
Nope.

532
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,473
Okay.

533
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,208
Well, this is awkward.

534
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,010
It's not awkward.

535
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,645
I like your company.

536
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,982
You're sweet.

537
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,484
When did you come out?

538
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,186
About 25 years ago.

539
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,356
The NYPD was not ready
for an openly gay Detective.

540
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,258
But then the old guard
died out.

541
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,494
Suddenly, they couldn't wait
to show off the fact

542
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,629
that they had a highly ranking
gay officer.

543
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,164
I made Captain.

544
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:01,234
But they put me
in a public affairs unit.

545
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,369
I was a good soldier.
I helped recruitment.

546
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,407
But all I ever really wanted
was my own command.

547
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,343
And now I finally got it.

548
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,979
And I'm not gonna
screw it up.

549
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,715
Captain, I'm sorry.
I...

550
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,850
I feel like a jackass.

551
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,990
But on the flip side,
there's Ratko.

552
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,359
Humility over.
I'm amazing!

553
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,441
Fantastic.
3,000 identical blue doors.

554
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,559
Looks like we all
got door duty.

555
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,805
Ah, yeah.
From before.

556
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:42,591
Good one.
You look great.

557
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:45,979
Clear.

558
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,318
Clear.

559
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,464
Okay.

560
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,865
Unbelievable!

561
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,567
Un-believable!

562
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,212
Ah.

563
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,114
Ratko, great to see you.

564
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,416
You can't stop me.

565
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,817
I'm going.

566
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:28,021
Actually,
you're not going anywhere.

567
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,756
'Cause if you take a look
to your left,

568
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:32,725
you'll see Detective's
Boyle and Diaz.

569
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,495
Right there
is Detective Santiago.

570
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,597
And behind you
is Captain Holt.

571
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:40,166
Point is...
My team has you surrounded.

572
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,402
Oh, my God,
I just got the tie thing!

573
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,370
Captain,
I just figured it out.

574
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,572
Maybe now's not
the best time, Detective.

575
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,107
It's a uniform!

576
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,209
We're a team,
and the tie is a part

577
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,011
of that team's uniform,
right?

578
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,279
You ask Ratko what team?

579
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:54,447
No, Ratko, shut up.

580
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:55,848
It's important to you

581
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,150
because you were kept
off the team for so long.

582
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,518
And now you're the coach,

583
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,054
and you want us to
all wear that same uniform.

584
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:02,488
Boom! Nailed it!

585
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,391
Yes, you did.
Now just arrest Ratko.

586
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,327
All right, Ratko, down.
Drop the weapon.

587
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:10,363
Hands on your head.
Here we go.

588
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,365
- Hey!
- He's running!

589
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh!
Got him!

590
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,802
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back!

591
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:17,337
<i>Stay down.</i>

592
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,639
That's how we do it
in the nine-nine, sir.

593
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,208
Catch bad guys
and look good doing it.

594
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:25,013
What's wrong with you?

595
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:26,889
Never took off the speedo.
Big mistake.

596
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,459
It is inside me.
Great work, team!

597
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,059

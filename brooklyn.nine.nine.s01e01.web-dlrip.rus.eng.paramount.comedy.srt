1
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:04,548
This job is eating me alive.

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:06,691
I can't breathe anymore.

3
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:09,153
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy,

4
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,615
the man in the white hat.

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:14,174
I'm not becoming like them.

6
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,507
I am them.

7
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:19,098
Hey! What are
you doing, weirdo?

8
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,856
I'm doing the best speech
from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,583
Or actually,

10
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:24,885
ten of me are doing the best
speech from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

11
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:26,708
What's up?

12
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,851
Get it together, man.
Okay?

13
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:30,513
<i>So the store was hit
about two hours ago.</i>

14
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,912
<i>They took mostly tablets,
laptops, and cameras.</i>

15
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,516
Sorry.

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,889
I'd like a list
of all your employees,

17
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,865
whoever had access
to the store.

18
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,815
I'd also like to apologize
for my partner.

19
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:45,542
His parents didn't give him
enough attention.

20
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,566
Uh, Detective...

21
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:48,101
<i>I already solved the case.</i>

22
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,571
We're looking
for three white males,

23
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,202
one of whom has sleeve tats
on both arms.

24
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:52,865
And how do you know that?

25
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:54,688
I had an informant
on the inside.

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,223
He's been here for years.

27
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:59,005
Watching, learning.
Waiting.

28
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,275
His code name?

29
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,353
Fuzzy Cuddle bear.

30
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,176
He's a nanny cam.

31
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,902
You got lucky.

32
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,598
No, I got here five minutes
before you

33
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,197
and figured that in
this gigantic electronics store,

34
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,084
there had to be at least
one working camera.

35
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,130
Oh! Hi, bad guys!

36
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,400
<i>You did it, fuzzy.
You busted 'em.</i>

37
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,191
It's time to come home.

38
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:19,982
I'm not sure
if I can.

39
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,955
I've been undercover so long,
I've forgotten who I am.

40
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,874
I have seen terrible things.

41
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,144
I haven't known the touch
of a woman in many moons.

42
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,711
All right.

43
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:31,173
Detective Santiago!

44
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,836
Don't walk away from me!

45
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:42,059

46
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,755
<i>Yes, I did crack the case.</i>

47
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,770
So, Santiago,
would you do the honors?

48
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,885
Ohhh!

49
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,261
I hate this!

50
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:55,475
<i>Ah, yeah.</i>

51
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:56,851
I hate this.

52
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,970
<i>And you're just
gonna add one.</i>

53
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,281
<i>I'm winning.</i>

54
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:01,967
<i>It's a good feeling.</i>

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,822
It's a good feeling.
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:04,972
Enjoy it while it lasts.

57
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:06,315
I will!

58
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:08,554
JP, update
on the Morgenthau murder?

59
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,145
Yeah! Good news
for all you murder fans.

60
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,871
Earlier this morning...

61
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:15,109
Someone decided
to shoot and kill

62
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,475
luxury food importer
Henry Morgenthau.

63
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:19,426
Body was found
by the cleaning lady,

64
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,016
during her interview, I deduced,
using expert Detective work,

65
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,063
that she had something
super gross on her chin.

66
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,517
I think it was flan.

67
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:28,731
Charles thinks it was flan.

68
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,202
I think
it was butterscotch pudding.

69
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:31,769
Maybe it was just
old person gunk.

70
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,240
You know how old people
always have that gunk on them.

71
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:34,455
Oldie gunk.
Could be, yeah.

72
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,702
Anyone else?

73
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,142
How about we focus
on the murder

74
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:39,029
and not the old person gunk?

75
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,307
Crime techs are
at the scene now.

76
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:41,426
We're heading back
when they're done.

77
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,897
Okay, I want you on this.

78
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,272
It's gonna be priority one
for the new C.O.

79
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,031
Wait, tell us
about the new Captain.

80
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,214
Captain Holt
will be here soon.

81
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:51,339
He'll wanna introduce himself.
Dismissed.

82
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:54,670
Hey, Gina.

83
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,295
You know any scalpers?

84
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,118
I wanna ask Rosa to go to
the Rihanna concert with me,

85
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,237
but it's sold out.

86
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,124
Okay,
two points to make here.

87
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,755
First, Rihanna...

88
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:03,873
You...

89
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,729
And then Rihanna.

90
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,839
Yeah.
What's your second point?

91
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,150
She's got a type.

92
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,165
Which is really anyone
but you.

93
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:13,563
Yeah, that was
my ex-wife's type too.

94
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:17,145
Look, a Rihanna concert's
a pretty big swing, man.

95
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:20,119
- I don't know.
- She's into watching old movies.

96
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:23,379
Cool. Where would I find a place
that shows old movies?

97
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,330
Oh, yeah, just go
on the Internet

98
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,752
and search for the phrase
"I want to buy two movie tickets

99
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,351
for a girl
who doesn't like me."

100
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,877
- Great. Thank you.
- Good.

101
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:36,587
Hey, you heard anything
about the new Captain?

102
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,441
Uh, no, and I don't care.

103
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,583
I just wish Captain McGintley
never left, he was the best.

104
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,054
He was terrible.

105
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,237
You just liked him
'cause he let you do

106
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,485
anything you wanted.

107
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,203
On your marks, get set...

108
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,642
<i>Go.</i>

109
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,240
What the hell's going on
around here?

110
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,446
Fire extinguisher
roller chair derby?

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,206
Okay.

112
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:55,773
And go!

113
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:01,048
Yeah!

114
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,967
What's your point?

115
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,046
If I'm ever gonna make Captain,
I need a good mentor.

116
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,037
I need my rabbi.

117
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,764
Sorry, dude...

118
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:09,490
But this new guy's gonna be
another washed-up pencil pusher

119
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:10,577
who's only concerned with...

120
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,825
Following every rule

121
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,711
in the patrol guide.

122
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,485
Meep morp zeep.
Robot Captain Engage.

123
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,435
- Is that what you think?
- He-hey!

124
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,898
New Captain alert.

125
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,529
You must be the new C.O.

126
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,575
I'm Detective Jake Peralta.
Great to meet you.

127
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,174
Now don't let me interrupt.

128
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,420
You were describing what
kind of person I'm gonna be.

129
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,700
I'd like you to finish.

130
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:33,281
That's not necessary.

131
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:36,191
Or I could recap
very quickly, sure.

132
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,918
Um, let's see.

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,516
I think I said some joke

134
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:41,403
about being
a washed-up pencil pusher.

135
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,162
- Now do the robot voice.
- Which...

136
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:45,177
The robot voice
you were doing

137
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,968
when you implied
I'm a rule-following robot.

138
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,845
I wanna hear it again.

139
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,994
Meep morp... zarp.

140
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,008
Robot.

141
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,246
- That's a terrible robot voice.
- Yep.

142
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,525
The next time I see you,

143
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,635
I'd like you
to be wearing a necktie.

144
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,546
Oh, actually, the last Captain
didn't care if we wore ties.

145
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,825
Well, your new Captain does.

146
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,135
And more importantly,

147
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,118
he cares that you follow
his direct orders.

148
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,269
Everyone,

149
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,645
I'm your new
commanding officer,

150
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,946
- Captain Ray Holt.
- Speech!

151
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,536
- That was my speech.
- Short and sweet.

152
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,374
- Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:24,092
I love that guy.

154
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:25,211
Same!

155
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:26,939
He's so suave.

156
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,327
Does anyone get
a little bit of a gay vibe?

157
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,022
No? Okay.

158
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,514
Sergeant, you were
in the 1-8 with me...

159
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:37,810
Though you were
significantly...

160
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,929
Fatter, sir.

161
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,752
They called me
"Terry Titties."

162
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:43,567
Because I had large, uh...

163
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,229
Titties, yes.
I remember.

164
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,732
I never liked
that nickname.

165
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,715
Though to be fair,
it was accurate.

166
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,792
What's this I hear about you
being on administrative leave?

167
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:55,365
A year ago, my wife and I
had twin baby girls.

168
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,092
Cagney and Lacey.

169
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,851
They have adorable
chubby cheeks.

170
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:01,634
Ever since, I kinda got
scared of getting hurt.

171
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,712
Lost my edge.

172
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,109
There was an incident
in a department store.

173
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,449
Hey, man, you okay?
You look a little jumpy.

174
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,626
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

175
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,657
Ahhh!

176
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,420
I think he's dead.

177
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,467
And I'm still not right.

178
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,610
Tell me about
your Detective squad.

179
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:25,200
Um...

180
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,246
Well, Scully, Hitchcock,
and Daniels.

181
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:28,525
<i>They're pretty much
worthless,</i>

182
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,836
but they make good coffee.

183
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,595
Copy that.

184
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:33,321
Now the good ones.

185
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,441
Rosa Diaz.

186
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:38,406
<i>Tough, smart, hard to read,
and really scary.</i>

187
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,540
Tell me who has me
for secret santa.

188
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:44,833
No! That takes all the fun
out of it.

189
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,295
It's Scully.
He got you a scarf.

190
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,717
- I'll make him return it.
- Yes, you will.

191
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,796
Charles Boyle.
He's a grinder.

192
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,362
<i>Not the most brilliant
Detective,</i>

193
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,962
<i>but he works harder
than anyone else.</i>

194
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,734
He's not physically gifted.

195
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,357
Oh, man!
My muffin.

196
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,796
Ahh!

197
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,969
Oh, my head!
My muffin, my head!

198
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,889
And I stepped on the...
On my muffin!

199
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,008
And my head and my muffin.

200
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,918
<i>Amy Santiago.</i>

201
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,580
She's got seven brothers,

202
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:14,859
so she's always trying
to prove she's tough.

203
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:17,034
Careful.
That stuff's pretty hot.

204
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,497
Oh, is it? Hmm?

205
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,135
<i>She and Peralta
have some big bet</i>

206
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,734
<i>over who gets
more arrests this year.</i>

207
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,644
Ever since the bet,
their numbers have gone way up.

208
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,116
Tell me about Peralta.

209
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,993
<i>Jacob Peralta
is my best Detective.</i>

210
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,456
He likes putting away bad guys
and he loves solving puzzles.

211
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:44,726
The only puzzle
he hasn't solved

212
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:46,772
is how to grow up.

213
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,851
That was very well put.

214
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,985
I've talked a lot about Jake
in my departmentally mandated

215
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,647
therapy sessions.

216
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,279
Look, you know my history.

217
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,621
You know how important
this is to me.

218
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,060
This precinct is doing fine,

219
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,427
but I wanna make it
the best one in Brooklyn.

220
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,481
And I need your help.

221
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,887
Absolutely, sir.

222
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,479
Where do we start?

223
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:07,883
* What is happening?

224
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,443
We start with him.

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,141
Okay, so the perp came in
through the window,

226
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:15,580
<i>left the muddy red footprint,</i>

227
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,370
<i>and apparently had sex
with the dish rack.</i>

228
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,417
Shell casing found here.
Two shots.

229
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,664
Bang, bang.

230
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,455
Great work, Detective.

231
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:23,989
You get a tie.

232
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,333
Hey, that's mine.
You took it from my desk.

233
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,391
That's right, Charles.
Good solve.

234
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,667
- Tie for you.
- Thanks!

235
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,106
Now everyone be sure
to put those on

236
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,449
because it's impossible
to solve crimes

237
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,103
- unless you're wearing a tie.
- Lay off the Captain.

238
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,733
That man is gonna be
my rabbi.

239
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,365
Okay, first of all,
when you use the word "rabbi,"

240
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,804
you know that turns me on

241
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,082
and that's unfair
in the work environment.

242
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,577
Secondly, your rabbi
is a pain in my ass.

243
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,240
Yeah, he's a little
too serious.

244
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,678
- What do you think, Rosa?
- He seems cool.

245
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,245
Yeah, he seems cool.
I agree.

246
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,963
Looks like the perp stole
a computer, a watch,

247
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:52,481
and a Jamon Iberico ham,
valued at... what!

248
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,983
$6,000.

249
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,903
$6,000 for a ham?

250
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:59,260
Jamon Iberico is an amazing
cured ham from Spain.

251
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,795
They had it
at my uncle's funeral.

252
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,033
I gorged myself
at that funeral.

253
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,632
I mean, I was constipated
for three days.

254
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,902
Wow, that's a great story,
Charles, thank you.

255
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,660
<i>All right,
listen up, everybody.</i>

256
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,004
Better contact Captain Holt,

257
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,251
let him know
we got a ten-tie situation.

258
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,065
Speaking of ties,
where's yours, meep morp?

259
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,249
This is fantastic.

260
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,847
Captain!
Hey!

261
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,117
Welcome to the murder.
What are you doing here?

262
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,461
I like to know
what my detectives are up to.

263
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,219
- That okay by you?
- Yep.

264
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,626
Take Santiago
and knock on doors.

265
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:24,969
See if the neighbors
heard anything.

266
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,344
Door duty?
It's a waste of time.

267
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:28,102
Diaz and Boyle.
Check in the coroner.

268
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>Report back to me
in an hour.</i>

269
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,571
- That went well.
<i>- No, it didn't.</i>

270
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,129
He's got like super hearing.

271
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,952
Hey, Rosa!
Rosa. Rosa!

272
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,533
Um, I just happened
to notice

273
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,133
that there's
an old movie festival

274
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,946
playing at the film forum
this week.

275
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,448
Wanna go?

276
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,632
Sure.

277
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:50,391
Cool! Awesome.

278
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,118
<i>There's a bunch
of movie options.</i>

279
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,187
<i>I'll probably just go
with something classic</i>

280
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,786
like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

281
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:58,641
<i>Citizen Kane</i> is terrible.
Pick a good movie.

282
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:01,071
<i>Good call. Smart.</i>

283
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:02,510
<i>I'll do it.</i>

284
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:05,996
I'll pick a better movie
than <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

285
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,626
<i>So Gina...</i>

286
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,577
Civilian administrators
like yourself

287
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,304
often have their ear
to the ground.

288
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,775
What do Santiago and Peralta

289
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,117
have riding
on this bet of theirs?

290
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:16,612
I will tell you
on six conditions.

291
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,562
<i>Number one, you let me
use your office</i>

292
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,001
to practice my dance moves.

293
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,089
Second...
How about this?

294
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,848
- If you tell me...
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:24,542
I won't
have you suspended...

296
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,629
Without pay.

297
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,004
Oh, that sounds great.

298
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,850
Okay, the deal is
if Amy gets more arrests,

299
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,737
Jake has to give her
his car.

300
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,911
It's an old Mustang,
and it's pretty sweet.

301
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,510
If he gets more arrests,

302
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,132
she has to go
on a date with him.

303
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,490
He guarantees
it will end in sex.

304
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:44,399
I bet on at least
some over-the-clothes action.

305
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,998
At the very least,
some touching...

306
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:47,310
- No, that's enough, Gina.
- Caresses.

307
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:49,483
I could see him showing up
in a silk robe.

308
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:50,539
- That's enough, Gina.
- All right.

309
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,946
Thank you.

310
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,280
<i>Let the wasting of time begin.</i>

311
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,798
Hello, sir.

312
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,109
Can we ask you
a few questions?

313
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,771
Definitely.
Yeah.

314
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,626
I'm actually... I'm super glad
you guys are here right now.

315
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,257
Are you smelling
that weed smell?

316
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,344
Yeah.

317
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,303
'Cause a dude broke in,

318
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:08,191
smoked weed,
and bolted.

319
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,501
It's...

320
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:10,940
Do you think
it's the same dude

321
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:12,603
that left that bong there
on the floor?

322
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,065
Yes.

323
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,135
Police!

324
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,214
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,300
What's your name?

326
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,516
- My name?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,243
- Mlepnos.
- Can you spell that, please?

328
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:28,879
M-l-e-p...

329
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,094
Clay.

330
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,214
Did you say "Clay"?

331
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,525
Yes, the "Clay" is silent.

332
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,187
All right, got it.

333
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:37,481
Have you seen this man before?
He was shot last night.

334
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,103
Oh. Thank you.

335
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:41,766
No, sir, that's ours.
We need that.

336
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,685
- We...
- And he kept it.

337
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,316
Wall Street journal
<i>on the doormat...</i>

338
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,754
Top floor apartment.

339
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:49,184
20 bucks says this guy's
like a hot, eligible bachelor.

340
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll take that action.

341
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,214
Police! Open up!

342
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,101
Hello.

343
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,635
Oh! Hello, sir!

344
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:57,979
How are you today?

345
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,545
I am Detective
Right-All-The-Time,

346
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,711
and this is my partner
Detective Terrible Detective.

347
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,972
No surprises from the coroner.

348
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:07,603
A few gunshots,
shoulder and chest.

349
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,682
None of the neighbors heard
or saw anything.

350
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:12,784
And what's worse, Santiago
struck out with a 92-year-old.

351
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,062
That is not accurate, sir.

352
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,853
Wait, you hooked up
with him? Ugh!

353
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,580
All right, hit the pawn shops
and canvass the neighborhood.

354
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,955
And while you're out,
you can buy yourself a tie.

355
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,362
<i>Oh, actually, sir...</i>

356
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:22,248
I'm wearing a tie right now.

357
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:23,751
Check it out.

358
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:26,054
Secret tie.

359
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,365
First of all, I think
you're kind of overdoing it

360
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:28,708
with the manscaping.

361
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,115
<i>But more importantly,
Detective,</i>

362
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,193
why do you refuse to
take my orders seriously?

363
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,920
Does anyone here know why
it's so important to me

364
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,446
that you all dress
appropriately?

365
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:38,606
<i>Hmm. Four highly trained
detectives</i>

366
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,860
<i>and not one of you
can solve this simple mystery.</i>

367
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,258
I wanna be briefed
on any new developments.

368
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:44,633
Any questions?

369
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,911
I was gonna ask you
if you thought I was doing

370
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:47,351
too much manscaping,
but we solved that one.

371
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,821
So I'm good.

372
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,101
<i>Hey, Boyle.</i>

373
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,795
- Yep.
- What about this fancy ham stuff?

374
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,297
- Jamon Iberico.
- Yes.

375
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:54,673
The perp left
a really expensive TV

376
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,975
but then stole ham?
It doesn't make sense.

377
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,374
Is there a place nearby
the crime scene that sells it?

378
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,260
- Beneficio's might.
- Let's go.

379
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,699
You gotta brief
the C.O. first.

380
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,481
We'll brief him
after we catch the guy.

381
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,446
My name is Ratko.
I don't know anything.

382
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:10,886
Oh, okay.

383
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,196
You recognize this guy?

384
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:15,457
- Henry Morgenthau?
- No.

385
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,920
Maybe actually look
at the picture.

386
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,871
I don't know him.
I don't know what happened.

387
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,405
No more questions.

388
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,132
Well, why don't I run
a scenario past you, Ratko,

389
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,411
and you tell me
what you think?

390
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:25,754
You do know Morgenthau.

391
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:26,969
He came in here and tried
to sell you some hams.

392
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,120
You knew they were worth
a lotta money,

393
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,208
so you tried to steal them
from him

394
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,327
when he wasn't home.

395
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:31,478
Only he was home,
so you shot him.

396
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,461
Does that sound familiar?

397
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,996
Uh, maybe some role play
will jog your memory?

398
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,115
- Great idea.
- Okay, yeah.

399
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,106
Okay.

400
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,473
- So I'm... I'm Ratko.
- No, no, I'm Ratko.

401
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:40,976
Come on.
I'm always the victim.

402
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,542
Look, I'm doing this
with you right here.

403
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:43,661
Fine, fine.

404
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,420
Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau,

405
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:47,946
owner of delicious
and expensive hams.

406
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,385
Don't I know you
from the grocery store?

407
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,527
Kill!
And scene.

408
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:55,653
<i>NYPD! Everyone down!</i>

409
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,059
Ma'am, if you could
just get down,

410
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,787
or... ignore me
and continue shopping.

411
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,216
Boyle, get the door!
On it!

412
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,839
Ratko!

413
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,036
Oh!

414
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:10,042
Ow!

415
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,560
Ha ha ha!

416
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,219
<i>Ow, Ratko, ow!</i>

417
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,403
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Ratko!

418
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,426
I'm getting mad!

419
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,897
That's a waste of manchego!

420
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,208
Charles!

421
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,484
How are you still here?
<i>Jake!</i>

422
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:30,955
Little help!

423
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,810
Ratko! He's not going
anywhere, Jake!

424
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:34,120
Ratko!

425
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,560
I got him! I got him!

426
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,694
Don't worry!

427
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:41,475
So no, I did not brief you.

428
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,170
<i>And yes, he did get away.</i>

429
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:46,017
But some bonus good news...

430
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,191
I got you hazelnut.

431
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:50,428
And...

432
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,306
A little spoon
there for you.

433
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,771
Is he seriously
assigning me

434
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,211
to the records room?

435
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,969
I mean, why do we even have
a records room?

436
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,407
Computer's been invented, right?
I didn't dream it?

437
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,782
You're lucky, man.

438
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,181
I wish I could get
assigned here full-time.

439
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:08,730
You could not be farther
from the action.

440
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,841
Sergeant, you know me.
I have more arrests than anyone.

441
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,344
Will you please tell the Captain
how dumb it is

442
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,334
to lock his best Detective
in a file cabinet?

443
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,340
Second best.
You're wrong about Holt.

444
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,684
That man has forgotten more
about being a cop

445
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,763
than you will ever know.

446
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,960
In 1981, he caught
the disco strangler.

447
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:26,414
It's over, disco man!

448
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:29,195
Put down the yo-yo
and back away from the girl.

449
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,649
Wow.

450
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,846
The man is the real deal.
You need to listen to him.

451
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,445
Gonna be hard to win our bet

452
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,141
when you're
on the bench, Peralta.

453
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,402
Although I did start
a new category.

454
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:43,968
"Murderers we let go."

455
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,344
And look at that.

456
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:47,965
You're winning.

457
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,468
Have fun with your files.

458
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:50,875
Yeah, you know what,
I will have fun with my files.

459
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:54,394
Have fun with your face!

460
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,056
Slam!

461
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,784
That was a slam.

462
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:02,547
So what movie did you
get us tickets to?

463
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:03,923
Oh, well,
just to be safe,

464
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,128
I bought tickets
to all of them.

465
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,888
Just to be safe?
What does that mean?

466
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,541
I don't know,
I didn't wanna mess up.

467
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,164
Because you're sort of...
Opinionated.

468
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,211
You think I'm opinionated?
Okay, here's an opinion for you.

469
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:16,841
You're a bad judge
of character

470
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,888
and your shirt
looks like vomit.

471
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,063
So we can go see
<i>North by Northwest.</i>

472
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:22,181
We're not seeing
a movie together.

473
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,620
Good call.
Smart.

474
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:24,867
<i>Keep it profesh.</i>

475
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,146
- Hey, Captain.
- <i>So you found something?</i>

476
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,713
Hey, I like the tie.

477
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:41,015
If you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.

478
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,518
Anyway, I think
I got something good here.

479
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,437
Turns out the name "Ratko"
is made up.

480
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,972
But I was digging
through these files...

481
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:48,434
One of which I literally
found in a spider web...

482
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:49,905
And it turns out there were
a bunch of references

483
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,311
to a serbian thug,

484
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:53,071
street names "the rat"
and "the butcher,"

485
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,052
<i>who's known to hang out
at a storage unit</i>

486
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,963
near Boerum Park,
which has red soil,

487
00:16:57,964 --> 00:17:01,672
hence, the muddy red footprint
on Morgenthau's counter.

488
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,174
That's fine work,
Detective.

489
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,021
Thank you very much, sir.

490
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,652
Testament to what
can be achieved

491
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,242
when you dress appropriately.

492
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,161
Let's pound it out.

493
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:18,109
You know what,
such fine police work,

494
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,059
let's share it
with the whole team.

495
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,489
<i>Santiago! Boyle! Diaz!
Get in here!</i>

496
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,120
Bring everyone!
And a camera!

497
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:27,367
That's not necessary.
Oh, they're here!

498
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,908
<i>Of the fine master Detective,
Jake Peralta.</i>

499
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:30,899
Yeah, let's have a hand,
everyone.

500
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,106
- Give him a hand.
- Yeah, nice!

501
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:35,471
Looking good!

502
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,879
Yeah.
Thank you.

503
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,733
No record of Ratko on the ledger.

504
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,204
Must've used cash.

505
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,995
Well, I, for one,
am just pumped

506
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,818
to be on a stakeout
with you, Captain.

507
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,992
You know what my favorite thing
about stakeouts is?

508
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,295
Patrol guide says
"no dress code."

509
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,685
So I'm just the zip-up hoodie
and my two best friends.

510
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:53,251
Does he always
talk this much?

511
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,625
I just tune it out.

512
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:56,034
It's like
a white noise machine.

513
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,047
Okay, first of all,
that's racist.

514
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,806
Secondly, Captain,

515
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,140
Terry told me
you caught the disco strangler.

516
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,603
That's incredible.
I've read that case.

517
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,362
With all due respect, sir,

518
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:09,112
why'd it take you so long
to get your first command?

519
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,359
Because I'm gay.

520
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,173
Ah.

521
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,026
Seriously?

522
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm surprised
you didn't know.

523
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,728
I don't try to hide it.

524
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:27,658
Did anyone else get
a little bit of a gay vibe?

525
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,207
Manscaping.

526
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,413
Damn!

527
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:36,036
I am not a good Detective.

528
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,827
<i>Here.</i>

529
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,265
I feel bad that you spent all
that money on the movie tickets.

530
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,449
Why don't you just go
to the movies with me?

531
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,591
Nope.

532
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:46,109
Okay.

533
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,771
Well, this is awkward.

534
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:49,499
It's not awkward.

535
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,065
I like your company.

536
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:55,222
You're sweet.

537
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,661
When did you come out?

538
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,292
About 25 years ago.

539
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:02,289
The NYPD was not ready
for an openly gay Detective.

540
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,111
But then the old guard
died out.

541
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:06,254
Suddenly, they couldn't wait
to show off the fact

542
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,300
that they had a highly ranking
gay officer.

543
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,772
I made Captain.

544
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:12,713
But they put me
in a public affairs unit.

545
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:14,759
I was a good soldier.
I helped recruitment.

546
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,629
But all I ever really wanted
was my own command.

547
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,442
And now I finally got it.

548
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,969
And I'm not gonna
screw it up.

549
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,591
Captain, I'm sorry.
I...

550
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:28,637
I feel like a jackass.

551
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,521
But on the flip side,
there's Ratko.

552
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,792
Humility over.
I'm amazing!

553
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,537
Fantastic.
3,000 identical blue doors.

554
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:46,567
Looks like we all
got door duty.

555
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,719
Ah, yeah.
From before.

556
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,348
Good one.
You look great.

557
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:55,594
Clear.

558
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,669
Clear.

559
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,309
Okay.

560
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,652
Unbelievable!

561
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,283
Un-believable!

562
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:27,443
Ah.

563
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,266
Ratko, great to see you.

564
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:31,472
You can't stop me.

565
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:32,815
I'm going.

566
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,885
Actually,
you're not going anywhere.

567
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,548
'Cause if you take a look
to your left,

568
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,394
you'll see Detective's
Boyle and Diaz.

569
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:43,048
Right there
is Detective Santiago.

570
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,062
And behind you
is Captain Holt.

571
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:47,524
Point is...
My team has you surrounded.

572
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,667
Oh, my God,
I just got the tie thing!

573
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,553
Captain,
I just figured it out.

574
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,663
Maybe now's not
the best time, Detective.

575
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:55,134
It's a uniform!

576
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:57,149
We're a team,
and the tie is a part

577
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,875
of that team's uniform,
right?

578
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,091
You ask Ratko what team?

579
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,211
No, Ratko, shut up.

580
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:02,553
It's important to you

581
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,801
because you were kept
off the team for so long.

582
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,112
And now you're the coach,

583
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,542
and you want us to
all wear that same uniform.

584
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:08,916
Boom! Nailed it!

585
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,699
Yes, you did.
Now just arrest Ratko.

586
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,554
All right, Ratko, down.
Drop the weapon.

587
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,464
Hands on your head.
Here we go.

588
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,382
- Hey!
- He's running!

589
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:19,949
Oh!
Got him!

590
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,676
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back!

591
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:23,147
<i>Stay down.</i>

592
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,353
That's how we do it
in the nine-nine, sir.

593
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:27,815
Catch bad guys
and look good doing it.

594
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:30,503
What's wrong with you?

595
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:32,300
Never took off the speedo.
Big mistake.

596
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,764
It is inside me.
Great work, team!

597
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,089

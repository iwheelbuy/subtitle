1
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:03,427
Hey, cap'n, got a second?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,081
- It's "Captain."
- What did I say?

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,608
"Cap'n,"
like cap'n crunch.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,887
All right,
but to be fair,

5
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:11,357
cap'n crunch
was a war hero

6
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:12,892
and the primary
male role model

7
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,705
in my house,
growing up, so...

8
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,976
Anyways, cap-tain,
you know

9
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,575
that jewelry store robbery
down by grand army Plaza?

10
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:22,133
- Mm-hmm.
- I know who did it... Dustin Whitman.

11
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:23,733
I put him in Rikers
two years ago.

12
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:24,980
He just got out,
and the crime scene

13
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,707
matches his M.O. perfectly.

14
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,561
Okay, what do we got?

15
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,823
Well, security cam
shows a male suspect, 5'9"...

16
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:33,360
Wearing a black ski mask.

17
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,862
He bypassed
the McConnell alarm

18
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,364
by using
the magnetic kill switch.

19
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:38,572
And he only stole diamonds,
nothing over two carats.

20
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,105
Yeah, exactly.
How'd you know?

21
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:43,016
I'm a Detective.
It's what I do.

22
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,959
I'm just kidding.
I need a lot more information.

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,556
But that would've been
a great exit line, right?

24
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,803
The crime techs
aren't done yet,

25
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,210
but I'm 100% sure
it's Whitman.

26
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,586
Well, let's see
what kind of physical evidence

27
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:53,568
they turn up,
and then we can talk arrest.

28
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,287
Actually,
hilarious story.

29
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:59,356
So that is Dustin Whitman.

30
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,394
You already arrested him?
With insufficient evidence?

31
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,071
By law, we have 48 hours
to find that evidence,

32
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,669
or we have to let him go.

33
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,075
You just started the clock.

34
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,926
What's up
with this emergency meeting?

35
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,707
Whoa, Detective Santiago.

36
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,463
Big date tonight.
How do I look?

37
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,286
Well, I think you look...

38
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:25,060
Sorry, that was supposed
to be a catcall.

39
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,531
I don't know
how this works.

40
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,514
Hey, is this why you were
getting makeup tips

41
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,306
from the prostitute
in the holding cell?

42
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,416
I just wanted to know
how she got such smoky eyes.

43
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,038
Turns out
it was an std rash.

44
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:36,030
Detective Peralta
has made a collar

45
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,341
in the jewelry store heist.

46
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:38,908
- Way to go, jakey.
- Ah, that's okay.

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,251
No. He didn't get
sufficient evidence

48
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:41,497
to make it stick,
so we have

49
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,640
the next 48 hours
to fix his mistake.

50
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,143
Damn it, Jake.

51
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,830
What evidence did you have
when you arrested this guy?

52
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,333
Some pretty ironclad stuff.

53
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,859
Dustin, it's been a while.

54
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,714
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

55
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,944
Well, well, well,
if it isn't joke Peralta.

56
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,918
That's it, you're under arrest.

57
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,141
Case closed?

58
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,251
If we don't find
something conclusive,

59
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,403
it jeopardizes the case

60
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,034
and opens the department up
to a lawsuit.

61
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,313
So cancel your plans.

62
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,561
We're here
until this is over.

63
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,799
- Damn it, Peralta.
- Ow!

64
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:11,078
I know everyone's mad
at Peralta

65
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:14,276
for ruining their weekend.

66
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:15,267
But?

67
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,387
That was it.

68
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,473
I was just demonstrating

69
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,256
for Detective Peralta
what a fact is.

70

71
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,580
Terry, you just
pulled two doubles.

72
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,115
You must be tired.

73
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:44,490
I'll stay
for this Whitman debacle.

74
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,057
- You go home.
- I'm not tired.

75
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,879
Why would you think
I was tired?

76
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,488
I ended up doing
25 minutes

77
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,037
of sleep chin-ups
on muscle memory alone.

78
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,189
Tired Terry still
gets after it,

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,916
that's all I'm saying.

80
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,097
Hey, Gina, can you

81
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,664
order food for us
at the flatbush diner?

82
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,007
They make the best pies
in New York City.

83
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,150
Oopsie, you said something
super dumb.

84
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,708
The best pie
in the city's at crust.

85
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:15,923
Wrong.
Ignorant and wrong.

86
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,098
Uh, you think you can
just bully people,

87
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,561
but you can't.
It's not okay.

88
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,927
I'm the bully around here,
ask anyone.

89
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,934
Boyle, you're always blogging
on that foodie website.

90
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,245
Which pie's better?

91
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:28,876
Yeah, whose do you like better,
mine or Rosa's?

92
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,210
Oh, uh, you know,
I-I haven't

93
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,928
been to either place yet.

94
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,207
Why is your eye twitching?

95
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,862
Wouldn't you like to know?

96
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,972
Could I see you for a second
in the evidence lockup?

97
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,052
Charles, I know
what's going on.

98
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,458
You've tried both pies.

99
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,185
You know mine is better.

100
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,944
But you're scared
to tell Rosa,

101
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,318
'cause you're into her.

102
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,599
What?

103
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,277
That is not true, okay?

104
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,164
I-I-I don't even like food.

105
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:57,147
- What?
- Who's Rosa?

106
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,033
Y-you're the scared one.

107
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,127
Planning your strategy?

108
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,037
No, I'm just making
funny faces at him.

109
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,115
This mirrored glass
is awesome.

110
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,355
It straight-up works.

111
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:12,113
An effective use
of your limited time.

112
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:14,511
It is, actually.
That's how I got him last time.

113
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,591
Let him stew for a little bit,
got in his head,

114
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:17,742
and he confessed.

115
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,396
- You better be right.
- I am.

116
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:22,539
Hey, make some funny faces
while I'm in there.

117
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,129
I wanna see if I can tell.

118
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,222
I didn't do anything, joke.

119
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,988
That's funny.

120
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,130
You said the exact
same thing last time.

121
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:37,985
And how'd that
work out for you?

122
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,521
Let's take a look.

123
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:42,750
Okay. Here's you
at your trial.

124
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,317
You in prison.

125
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,173
Me meeting Regis philbin.

126
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,962
That was fun.

127
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,401
You still in prison.

128
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:52,312
Me at splash mountain,
just pepper these in here.

129
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:53,815
You in prison,
you in prison,

130
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:54,935
you in prison,
you get it.

131
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,885
- You got the wrong guy.
- All right.

132
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,708
Not ready to confess?

133
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,881
Fine by me.

134
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:03,601
I got all the time
in the world.

135
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:06,383
No, you actually
have 48 hours.

136
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,526
I know the law.

137
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,925
Nuh-uh.

138
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,250
So looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

139
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,872
Should someone
do a coffee run?

140
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,624
You know what?
Coffee's on me.

141
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos
or anything,

142
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,748
I've only got, like,
10 bucks.

143
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,027
Okay.

144
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:30,367
Rise and shine, detectives,
rise and shine.

145
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:32,286
Peralta, I want you
to bring everyone up to speed.

146
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,268
You slept in your office,
and you look

147
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,933
exactly the same.
How?

148
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:37,754
What are you talking about?
My hair is a mess.

149
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,185
Oh, yeah.
Briefing room, five minutes.

150
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:42,391
How long were we asleep?

151
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,206
Just long enough for me
to squeeze in quick workout.

152
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,477
So, like, three hours.

153
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:48,851
- Morning.
-  Ugh.

154
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,418
I can't believe
you live nearby

155
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,954
and you won't let anyone crash
at your place.

156
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:54,128
You people already know
too much about me.

157
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
I know exactly
three facts about you,

158
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,038
and one of them
is that you won't

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,700
let any of us crash
at your place.

160
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,852
Is that a nightgown?

161
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:00,876
That's mine.

162
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:03,017
It's a t-shirt
from my fat phase.

163
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,511
"If at first
you don't secede,

164
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,174
try try again."

165
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:09,573
When you're that big,
you buy anything that fits.

166
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:12,068
A lot of fat guy clothes
have racist overtones.

167
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,986
Okay, a couple
of quick announcements.

168
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,353
First, I met
our night janitor Ronald.

169
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:19,552
If any of you are missing
hand sanitizer, he drank it.

170
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,982
Second, our warrants
finally went through.

171
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,838
We gotta place Whitman
at the scene and prove

172
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,043
that he either possessed
or sold those diamonds.

173
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,226
I know you're all tired,

174
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,570
but don't forget
why we're here.

175
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,233
Because we're
dedicated detectives.

176
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,767
- Because Peralta jumped the gun.
- Yep.

177
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,262
Get to work.

178
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,924
So we both
had good answers.

179
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,035
This isn't a joke.
You're ruining our weekend.

180
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,242
Okay, I'm sorry you had
to cancel dinner with your dad.

181
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,970
Date.
I had a date.

182
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:44,048
Hey, if Jake says
the guy did it,

183
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,807
that usually means
the guy did it.

184
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,374
Thank you.
Everyone listen to Rosa.

185
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,365
No, I'm still
furious at you.

186
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,516
Okay, no one
listen to Rosa.

187
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,403
She's clearly an accomplice
to this crime.

188
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,291
I'm gonna go take
another crack at Whitman.

189
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,537
You've been in there,
like, five times.

190
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:55,560
What are you gonna do?

191
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,551
Annoy him into talking?

192
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,990
Ha, ha.

193
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,557
Two, three, four.

194
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,354
Aah!

195
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,528
Didn't work.

196
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,125
Thank you.
Did not work.

197
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,376
Hey, Captain.

198
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,686
Will you please
let everyone else go?

199
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,157
I feel bad
that I ruined their weekend,

200
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:20,661
and I can tell
they're pissed at me.

201
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:22,900
I mean, Charles hasn't tried
to high-five me all morning.

202
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,274
Yes, I've taken
the brunt of that.

203
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,832
Kitchen buds.

204
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,399
Are you sure
Whitman did it?

205
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,775
Yes, I'm positive.

206
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,119
Then the whole team stays.

207
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,229
We have a better shot
with everyone on it.

208
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,988
Fine, will you at least
tell Hitchcock to go home?

209
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,193
His mouth smells like
rotten trout milk.

210
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:38,314
Is there such a thing?

211
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,591
I'm just telling you
what it smells like.

212
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,999
Get out.

213
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,685
- Do you have the bank records?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,828
Good thing I didn't reschedule
my date for tonight.

215
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,554
We're never leaving here.

216
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:49,025
Well, maybe that's
a good thing, you know?

217
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,880
Saved you from another
lame Internet date

218
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:55,645
with some lame guy named dirk
or mar... garine.

219
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:57,276
He's not lame, okay?

220
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,619
He works
with a friend of mine.

221
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,930
He has a human name.

222
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,305
And I'm not telling you
what it is,

223
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,905
because you'll look him up
and make fun of him.

224
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:05,078
I can't believe you think
so little of me

225
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,189
that you would just
automatically assume...

226
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,660
Is it Luke Mueller?

227
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,035
How did you do that?

228
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,954
Well, you only have
one friend... Kylie.

229
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,360
And she has
seven male coworkers.

230
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,247
Goatee, goatee,
jaunty fedora,

231
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:17,134
profile pic is a sunset,

232
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,469
tasmanian devil tattoo,
goatee.

233
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,282
Leaving Luke
as the only viable option.

234
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,434
Well, he's nice,

235
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,864
and he uses proper
punctuation in texts.

236
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,560
- Dreamboat.
- And I wanted to go out with him.

237
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,158
All right. You know what?
Reschedule for tonight.

238
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,821
I promise I will get us
out of here in time.

239
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:32,484
Fine.
I'm holding you to that.

240
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:33,698
Where's he taking you?

241
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,394
Terrific, let's get
everyone involved.

242
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,184
Dinner and a movie.

243
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,829
Dinner and a movie
is the perfect first date.

244
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,652
I think the perfect first date
doesn't feel like

245
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,699
a first date at all,
because you've known each other

246
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,001
for a few years,
maybe even work together.

247
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,951
And one night
you're laughing,

248
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:50,869
and then all of a sudden,
it's just like blammo!

249
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,597
Kissing.

250
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:55,987
Cheap dinner,
watch basketball, bone down.

251
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,280
So pretty much the same
as what I said.

252
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:02,445
None of the partials
match Whitman.

253
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,077
If he did it,
he didn't leave any prints.

254
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,900
Maybe he doesn't have any.

255
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,177
Interesting fact
about me...

256
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,129
I once burnt my fingerprints off
on a wok.

257
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,688
Hi, hello.

258
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,934
What are you doing?

259
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,245
Holt said you didn't
have to come in here.

260
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:15,781
You don't come in on days
you're supposed to work.

261
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,563
Because I'm so nice,
I brought two pies.

262
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,321
One is from crust.

263
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:23,680
And one's also
from flatbush diner.

264
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,822
Hey, you know what
might be fun?

265
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,157
Charles could try them
and tell us which one is better.

266
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,372
How fun is that?

267
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,577
- So fun.
- Yay!

268
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,689
Yum, yum, yum.
Yummy.

269
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,608
You got a second, Captain?

270
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,637
I've got these overtime forms
for you to s...

271
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,932
Are you stifling a yawn?

272
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,915
- No, sir.
- Go home, sergeant.

273
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,066
I'm fine.

274
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:49,519
And I filled this out.
I just need you to...

275
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:56,266
Permission to yawn, sir.

276
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,824
Go home.

277
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,636
Please, I'm begging you.

278
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,385
- Oh, fair enough.
- Yeah.

279
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,368
That's for women.

280
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,718
- These your glasses?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,708
They're gigantic.

282
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,404
My contacts dried out,
thanks to you.

283
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,898
And they're cool.
No, they're not.

284
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,105
Wow, you are blind blind.

285
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,087
- Yeah.
- You're a blind cop.

286
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,591
How has there not been
a made-for-TV movie

287
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,382
about your struggles?
Give those back.

288
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:29,876
Yeah, okay.

289
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:31,923
Wait a minute.

290
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,361
I did it.

291
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:34,897
I got Whitman,
dead to rights.

292
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,944
I can still make my date?
As I promised.

293
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,382
Go get changed.

294
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,598
And by that,
of course I mean

295
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,812
throw your glasses
in the garbage,

296
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,220
then get laser surgery,

297
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:44,587
then recuperate...
And she left the room.

298
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,615
It's all right.
6 out of 12.

299
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,799
Out of 12? Why?

300
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,749
For the 12 components
of food satisfaction:

301
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,236
Salty, sweet, sour,
bitter, umami, odor, sound...

302
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,994
Sound?
Come on, Charles.

303
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,584
Try her nasty pie.

304
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,764
Oh, wow.

305
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,299
That's the best pie
I ever had.

306
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,313
No, no.

307
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:09,655
- No, no, no.
- What's this?

308
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:12,055
We were running calls
to pawn shops

309
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,303
and then waiting for them
to call back.

310
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,157
I didn't ask
what you were doing.

311
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,011
I asked
what you are doing.

312
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,442
Pie taste test, it's over.
I won.

313
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,721
That's unacceptable.

314
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,375
If you wanna know which
restaurant has better pies,

315
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:26,860
you can't just have one guy
try one pie from each place.

316
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,970
Everybody needs to try

317
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,977
all the pies
from both places.

318
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,495
We gonna be here awhile.

319
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,189
Debit card statement.

320
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,309
You were at a parking meter

321
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,492
two blocks
from the jewelry store

322
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,379
an hour before the robbery.

323
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,472
Oh, no, you found out...
About my wife.

324
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,775
We both have cards, because
we share a joint account,

325
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,054
because we love each other.

326
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:50,876
You're incapable of love,
and I'll prove it!

327
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,027
Oh, I'm very tired.

328
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,786
I want my lawyer, now.

329
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:56,281
Ugh!

330
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,368
You have changed.

331
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,128
You used to go
straight to prison!

332
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,918
Did Whitman talk?

333
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:02,901
Oh, he talked all right.

334
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,180
He asked for his lawyer.

335
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,794
By using words,
which is technically talking.

336
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,168
We can't ask him
any more questions

337
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,257
till we find his lawyer,

338
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,695
and we can't find
his lawyer anywhere.

339
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,390
I'm sorry.

340
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,702
Aah, come on.

341
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:16,332
Why is there pie here?

342
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,506
That's not good.

343
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,691
I think the world of you,

344
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:20,938
as a colleague
and friend.

345
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,185
- Shut up, Peralta.
-  Yep.

346
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,139
- Yes!
- Another one for crust.

347
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,251
It's not looking good
for flatbush diner.

348
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,914
Ah, come on!

349
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:30,936
You went home and showered?

350
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,280
That's so unfair.

351
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,582
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Oh, cool.

352
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:35,830
Hey, can I borrow it?

353
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,653
Uh, why do you wanna
borrow the toothbrush?

354
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:38,611
What possible answer
could he give

355
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:39,795
that would make you say yes?

356
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:40,818
I wanna brush my teeth.

357
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,385
Jake, it's been
in my mouth.

358
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:43,695
That's the grossest thing
I've ever heard.

359
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,720
That's the grossest thing
you've ever heard?

360
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:45,935
You caught a guy
on the subway

361
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,597
with a bag of human ears.

362
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:48,781
Your thing's grosser.

363
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:49,933
Bring out the meringues.

364
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,523
I brought a few more.
That's so many.

365
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,375
You wanted something, sir?

366
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,193
Look, it's impossible
to make you leave.

367
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,006
But you do have to sleep,
and that's an order.

368
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,533
Sir, this is not necessary.

369
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:05,507
Also, can't sleep
without my whale songs.

370
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,010
Terry, I've seen this before.

371
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,664
Problems at home,
so you stay late at the job,

372
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,135
but that only
makes it worse.

373
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,214
Everything's great
with my wife.

374
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,005
It's just,
my brother-in-law's in town,

375
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,723
and we do not get along.

376
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:20,185
- He thinks I'm a weakling.
- You?

377
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,448
Let me get that for you.

378
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,782
I can do it.

379
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:29,491
Tiny Terry
loves his pickles.

380
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,313
He makes me feel so small.

381
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:32,945
Who cares what he thinks?

382
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,631
You're a police sergeant.
You're a grown man.

383
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,198
Now take your nap.

384
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,382
And if I see
the lights on in here,

385
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm gonna be
very disappointed in you.

386
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,641
Are you the idiot that made
a Friday night arrest?

387
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,176
I was in the poconos
with my wife.

388
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,423
You ruined
my entire weekend.

389
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:51,173
Get in line, because
that's their attitude.

390
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:52,709
Get your own attitude.

391
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,651
He has an alibi, geniuses.
He was at torque.

392
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:58,088
It's a nightclub in cape may,
New Jersey, all night.

393
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,072
Nice try.

394
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,384
You think I'm gonna
waste six hours

395
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:02,846
driving to the Jersey Shore
and back on some fake alibi?

396
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,092
It's up to you.

397
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,194
But in ten hours,
he walks.

398
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:12,023
More like in ten hours,
he walks into prison,

399
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:13,174
when we bust him.

400
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:14,614
Let's follow up
on his alibi.

401
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,788
- Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road.
- No.

402
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,972
You should've looked
into this

403
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:19,890
before you made the arrest.
You go.

404
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:20,945
Oh, Captain,
I'm happy to go.

405
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,322
I love the saltwater taffy
down there.

406
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,600
Scully loves
the saltwater taffy down there.

407
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,870
No, Peralta's going.
Go, Peralta.

408
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:28,077
Look, I know I caused
this problem, but I can fix it.

409
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:29,676
We just got
some new security footage in.

410
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:30,982
Let me stay here
and go through it.

411
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:33,033
I'm gonna prove that Whitman
was at the scene of the crime,

412
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,825
even if it kills me.

413
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:36,647
This is killing me.

414
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:39,109
Good. Die.

415
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,051
You know,
if it does come to that,

416
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:45,633
I have but one wish
before I go.

417
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,105
Can I please put your glasses
on my penis?

418
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:50,047
I just think
that would be really funny.

419
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,189
Hey,
can you make copies

420
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,340
of these warrant requests
for me?

421
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:54,908
I'm not your secretary.

422
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,475
You're everyone's secretary.

423
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,169
That's literally your job.

424
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,471
And your job is lying
about your taste buds?

425
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,158
I'm sorry about
the whole pie blowup thing.

426
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,214
You're right.

427
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:05,971
The flatbush diner pie
is awful.

428
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:09,203
- Thank you.
- It's just...

429
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,800
I want Rosa to like me.

430
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,976
All right,
do whatever you want,

431
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,024
but most women
don't really like it

432
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,614
when dudes lie to them.

433
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,758
Except for me,
but I'm wired

434
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,539
to thrive on dysfunction.

435
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,969
Nothing.

436
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,751
Wait, wait, wait. This guy...
5'9 " or 5'10",

437
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:28,870
black knit cap.

438
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,295
Come on, come on, come on.

439
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,896
Gotcha!

440
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:35,137
Ugh, it's not him.

441
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,272
Let's just arrest this guy.
Who even cares anymore?

442
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,671
So how'd my new best friend
Luke take it

443
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,822
when you
cancelled on him again?

444
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:45,019
Don't know,
hasn't called me back.

445
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,330
Which is
what always happens,

446
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:49,241
because it's impossible
to be a cop and date.

447
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,311
Amy, look.
There is a guy out there

448
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,101
with incredibly low standards

449
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,373
and a super weird
soul patch,

450
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,291
and he is waiting for you.

451
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,224
Amy, my patch
tingles for you.

452
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:05,103
We will wed on the isle
of New Jersey.

453
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,148
Our first dance will be
to jessie's girl,

454
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,738
because my name
is definitely jessie.

455
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,050
- It's so romantic.
- Hey, guys.

456
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,233
Hey.

457
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:14,471
Yeah, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

458
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:17,989
The bad news is my saltwater
taffy place was closed.

459
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,234
And the good news?

460
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,674
Whitman's alibi
checked out.

461
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:23,520
Security footage from torque
shows he was there.

462
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,120
That's not good news.

463
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:28,125
- That's bad news.
- Right. That is bad news.

464
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,140
Sorry, it's on me.

465
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:31,929
No, Detective Scully,
it's on Peralta.

466
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:35,575
No, Captain,
that's on Santiago.

467
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:37,558
It's on me.
It's still on me.

468
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,948
This is such a disaster.

469
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,249
It's not good.
D.A.'s furious.

470
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,914
Whitman and his lawyer
are in my office right now,

471
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:47,280
gunning for a lawsuit.
No, not that.

472
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:49,455
My brother-in-law is coming
to have dinner with me

473
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,012
on his way to jfk.

474
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:57,801
But also the botched
investigation, that's bad too.

475
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,446
Okay, what can I do?

476
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,484
Oh, your services
will not be necessary,

477
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,755
because you need to go home
and change for your date.

478
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,608
- What?
- I called handsome Luke.

479
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,113
I explained the weekend
was entirely

480
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,391
my fault, partially.

481
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,734
And he wants to go out
with you tonight.

482
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,229
- Thanks, Peralta.
- You're welcome.

483
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,317
Just promise me you won't
use the condoms

484
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:17,692
in the secret pocket
of your purse, okay?

485
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,579
- They're expired.
- How do you know what's in my purse?

486
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,306
I needed concealer
for a zit.

487
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:24,503
Plus, you know, we spend
so much time together here,

488
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,422
I know everything
about everyone.

489
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:29,108
I know Hitchcock
went bald at 15.

490
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:31,091
Scully used to date
Hitchcock's wife.

491
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,232
Charles has a bike with
a little basket on the front.

492
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,768
How else would you
carry baguettes?

493
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:37,230
And Rosa has a shower
in her apartment, I think.

494
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,638
I got nothing on her.

495
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:39,724
Good.

496
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,867
Well, I guess we did
just spend 48 hours

497
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:44,682
locked in here together.

498
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:48,711
Holy crap.

499
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:50,438
- What?
- Locked in here together.

500
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,421
So we will be filing
a wrongful arrest suit

501
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:54,147
against the NYPD.

502
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:57,441
And when I win,
I'm gonna buy club torque,

503
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,497
put a statue of Jake Peralta

504
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:59,840
right in the middle
of the dance floor.

505
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,854
First off,
that's a terrible threat.

506
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,231
I would love to have
a statue of myself

507
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,508
in the middle
of a dance club.

508
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,755
Second...

509
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,131
Do me a favor,
take a look at this picture,

510
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:08,282
and tell me what you see.

511
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:10,105
You and Regis philbin.

512
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,257
Awesome, right?

513
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,536
Surprisingly
down-to-earth guy

514
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,230
and definitely not the picture
I meant to show you.

515
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:15,735
But take a look at this.

516
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,837
That's right, it's you and
your old cell mate Marcus Cole.

517
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,938
And here he is again
outside the jewelry store.

518
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,602
The two of you planned this
together in prison.

519
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,946
You taught him your m.O,

520
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:26,224
he pulled off the robbery,

521
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,879
you got yourself an alibi,
and you split the loot.

522
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:31,437
Oh, man, I can't believe
he caught us.

523
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:32,621
Of course he did,

524
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:33,771
Peralta is the best!

525
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,466
Aw, thanks, reg.
That's enough.

526
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:36,681
Yeah, I gotta work
on my Regis.

527
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,960
Anyway, see ya in jail,
Whitman.

528
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,327
You got anything else
to say?

529
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,518
Hey, Rosa, the flatbush diner's
pie is terrible.

530
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,732
It's inedible.

531
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,139
Food is supposed
to be edible.

532
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,227
So you were lying?

533
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,561
What the hell, Boyle?

534
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,801
Put it
in the suck-it bucket.

535
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,782
Crust isn't any better.

536
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,405
It's fancier, but it's
all bells and whistles.

537
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:59,836
Desserts don't need
to be clever.

538
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,530
They just need to be good.

539
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:05,112
This is the best pie
in New York City...

540
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:09,942
Apple from argos bakery,
founded 1910.

541
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,980
Recipe unchanged.
Taste it.

542
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,192
Damn, it is amazing.

543
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,918
This pie is so good,
I hate it.

544
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,646
You just graduated
pie school, bitches.

545
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,141
Sorry I said "bitches,"
I'm just really worked up.

546
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,963
Yow!
Mmm, what is that?

547
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:28,842
Sorry for screwing up
everyone's weekend.

548
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,391
Hey, uh, drinks on me.
Who's in?

549
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:33,798
Oh, no way.
No, I got the date. I gotta change.

550
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,101
- Come on.
- Everyone's tired, Peralta.

551
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:37,412
They just wanna go home.

552
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:39,042
Yeah, but I have to prove
I'm not selfish,

553
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,194
so I don't care
what they want.

554
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,305
That sounded bad.

555
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,046
And to make up
for what I did, I'll cover

556
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:47,036
one shift each
for all of you.

557
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,284
No kidding?

558
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:49,660
- Except Santiago.
- What?

559
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:50,811
I got you your date back.

560
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,849
One nice thing from me
is all you get.

561
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,023
So this is my desk.

562
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,270
Desk jockey, huh?

563
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,573
You just sit here,
eat your pickles,

564
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,237
wait for the criminals
to turn themselves in.

565
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:02,707
Actually, I don't like
pickles that much.

566
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,145
Terry, I'm glad
I found you.

567
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,161
There's been a development
in the Russian mob case.

568
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,503
Oh?
Yeah, our killer

569
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:08,686
has been spotted
in the warehouse

570
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,285
down by the canal.
Get your gear.

571
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,203
So you want me first
through the door, sir?

572
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,325
Oh, it's just you.

573
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,987
The SWAT team
is on another call,

574
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,097
so you'll have
to do it alone.

575
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,113
Hey, I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

576
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,191
Hey, no, do your thing,
do your thing.

577
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:23,430
Go, Terry.

578
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,799
You can crash
on my couch.

579
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,443
I even downloaded you
some whale songs.

580
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,925
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget it.

581
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:36,352
Good night, Terry.

582
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,132

1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:03,079
Hey, cap'n, got a second?

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:05,848
- It's "Captain."
- What did I say?

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,483
"Cap'n,"
like cap'n crunch.

4
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:09,818
All right,
but to be fair,

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:11,352
cap'n crunch
was a war hero

6
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:12,954
and the primary
male role model

7
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,890
in my house,
growing up, so...

8
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:18,259
Anyways, cap-tain,
you know

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,927
that jewelry store robbery
down by grand army Plaza?

10
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,596
- Mm-hmm.
- I know who did it... Dustin Whitman.

11
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,265
I put him in Rikers
two years ago.

12
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,566
He just got out,
and the crime scene

13
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,368
matches his M.O. perfectly.

14
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:29,303
Okay, what do we got?

15
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:32,707
Well, security cam
shows a male suspect, 5'9"...

16
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,309
Wearing a black ski mask.

17
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,877
He bypassed
the McConnell alarm

18
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:37,445
by using
the magnetic kill switch.

19
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:39,748
And he only stole diamonds,
nothing over two carats.

20
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,349
Yeah, exactly.
How'd you know?

21
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:44,385
I'm a Detective.
It's what I do.

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,455
I'm just kidding.
I need a lot more information.

23
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,123
But that would've been
a great exit line, right?

24
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:50,424
The crime techs
aren't done yet,

25
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,892
but I'm 100% sure
it's Whitman.

26
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,327
Well, let's see
what kind of physical evidence

27
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,395
they turn up,
and then we can talk arrest.

28
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:58,232
Actually,
hilarious story.

29
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,435
So that is Dustin Whitman.

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,604
You already arrested him?
With insufficient evidence?

31
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,440
By law, we have 48 hours
to find that evidence,

32
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,108
or we have to let him go.

33
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,576
You just started the clock.

34
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,680
What's up
with this emergency meeting?

35
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:20,581
Whoa, Detective Santiago.

36
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,415
Big date tonight.
How do I look?

37
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,317
Well, I think you look...

38
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:28,254
Sorry, that was supposed
to be a catcall.

39
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,789
I don't know
how this works.

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,858
Hey, is this why you were
getting makeup tips

41
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,727
from the prostitute
in the holding cell?

42
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,929
I just wanted to know
how she got such smoky eyes.

43
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,665
Turns out
it was an std rash.

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Detective Peralta
has made a collar

45
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,068
in the jewelry store heist.

46
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,703
- Way to go, jakey.
- Ah, that's okay.

47
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:44,104
No. He didn't get
sufficient evidence

48
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,405
to make it stick,
so we have

49
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,641
the next 48 hours
to fix his mistake.

50
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,209
Damn it, Jake.

51
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,012
What evidence did you have
when you arrested this guy?

52
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,580
Some pretty ironclad stuff.

53
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,216
Dustin, it's been a while.

54
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,152
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

55
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,522
Well, well, well,
if it isn't joke Peralta.

56
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:03,582
That's it, you're under arrest.

57
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:04,858
Case closed?

58
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,060
If we don't find
something conclusive,

59
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,261
it jeopardizes the case

60
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,963
and opens the department up
to a lawsuit.

61
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,298
So cancel your plans.

62
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,600
We're here
until this is over.

63
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,935
- Damn it, Peralta.
- Ow!

64
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,270
I know everyone's mad
at Peralta

65
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,606
for ruining their weekend.

66
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,640
But?

67
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,808
That was it.

68
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,942
I was just demonstrating

69
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,846
for Detective Peralta
what a fact is.

70

71
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,095
Terry, you just
pulled two doubles.

72
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,697
You must be tired.

73
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,132
I'll stay
for this Whitman debacle.

74
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,767
- You go home.
- I'm not tired.

75
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,668
Why would you think
I was tired?

76
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:06,781
I ended up doing
25 minutes

77
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:10,484
of sleep chin-ups
on muscle memory alone.

78
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,685
Tired Terry still
gets after it,

79
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,487
that's all I'm saying.

80
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:14,721
Hey, Gina, can you

81
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,355
order food for us
at the flatbush diner?

82
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:17,757
They make the best pies
in New York City.

83
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,992
Oopsie, you said something
super dumb.

84
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:22,662
The best pie
in the city's at crust.

85
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:23,929
Wrong.
Ignorant and wrong.

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,198
Uh, you think you can
just bully people,

87
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,768
but you can't.
It's not okay.

88
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,237
I'm the bully around here,
ask anyone.

89
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,374
Boyle, you're always blogging
on that foodie website.

90
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:35,742
Which pie's better?

91
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,444
Yeah, whose do you like better,
mine or Rosa's?

92
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, uh, you know,
I-I haven't

93
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,716
been to either place yet.

94
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,050
Why is your eye twitching?

95
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,820
Wouldn't you like to know?

96
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,022
Could I see you for a second
in the evidence lockup?

97
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,191
Charles, I know
what's going on.

98
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,659
You've tried both pies.

99
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,461
You know mine is better.

100
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,296
But you're scared
to tell Rosa,

101
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:57,731
'cause you're into her.

102
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,066
What?

103
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:02,904
That is not true, okay?

104
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,873
I-I-I don't even like food.

105
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,942
- What?
- Who's Rosa?

106
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,911
Y-you're the scared one.

107
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,182
Planning your strategy?

108
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,218
No, I'm just making
funny faces at him.

109
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,387
This mirrored glass
is awesome.

110
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,723
It straight-up works.

111
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,558
An effective use
of your limited time.

112
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:25,060
It is, actually.
That's how I got him last time.

113
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,230
Let him stew for a little bit,
got in his head,

114
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:28,431
and he confessed.

115
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:31,201
- You better be right.
- I am.

116
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,436
Hey, make some funny faces
while I'm in there.

117
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:36,139
I wanna see if I can tell.

118
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,410
I didn't do anything, joke.

119
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,382
That's funny.

120
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,617
You said the exact
same thing last time.

121
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,553
And how'd that
work out for you?

122
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,155
Let's take a look.

123
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,525
Okay. Here's you
at your trial.

124
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,160
You in prison.

125
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,095
Me meeting Regis philbin.

126
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,963
That was fun.

127
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,465
You still in prison.

128
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,502
Me at splash mountain,
just pepper these in here.

129
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,070
You in prison,
you in prison,

130
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,238
you in prison,
you get it.

131
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,273
- You got the wrong guy.
- All right.

132
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,175
Not ready to confess?

133
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,443
Fine by me.

134
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:16,280
I got all the time
in the world.

135
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:19,183
No, you actually
have 48 hours.

136
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,419
I know the law.

137
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,922
Nuh-uh.

138
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,392
So looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

139
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,128
Should someone
do a coffee run?

140
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,999
You know what?
Coffee's on me.

141
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,500
Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos
or anything,

142
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,302
I've only got, like,
10 bucks.

143
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,636
Okay.

144
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,209
Rise and shine, detectives,
rise and shine.

145
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,211
Peralta, I want you
to bring everyone up to speed.

146
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,279
You slept in your office,
and you look

147
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,016
exactly the same.
How?

148
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,916
What are you talking about?
My hair is a mess.

149
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,452
Oh, yeah.
Briefing room, five minutes.

150
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,754
How long were we asleep?

151
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,691
Just long enough for me
to squeeze in quick workout.

152
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,060
So, like, three hours.

153
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,495
- Morning.
-  Ugh.

154
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,130
I can't believe
you live nearby

155
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,732
and you won't let anyone crash
at your place.

156
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,001
You people already know
too much about me.

157
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,702
I know exactly
three facts about you,

158
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,037
and one of them
is that you won't

159
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,772
let any of us crash
at your place.

160
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,973
Is that a nightgown?

161
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,042
That's mine.

162
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,276
It's a t-shirt
from my fat phase.

163
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,878
"If at first
you don't secede,

164
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,613
try try again."

165
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,116
When you're that big,
you buy anything that fits.

166
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,719
A lot of fat guy clothes
have racist overtones.

167
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:29,721
Okay, a couple
of quick announcements.

168
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,191
First, I met
our night janitor Ronald.

169
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,528
If any of you are missing
hand sanitizer, he drank it.

170
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,064
Second, our warrants
finally went through.

171
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,000
We gotta place Whitman
at the scene and prove

172
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,302
that he either possessed
or sold those diamonds.

173
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:43,536
I know you're all tired,

174
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,938
but don't forget
why we're here.

175
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,673
Because we're
dedicated detectives.

176
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,274
- Because Peralta jumped the gun.
- Yep.

177
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,877
Get to work.

178
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,612
So we both
had good answers.

179
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,814
This isn't a joke.
You're ruining our weekend.

180
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,117
Okay, I'm sorry you had
to cancel dinner with your dad.

181
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,919
Date.
I had a date.

182
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,088
Hey, if Jake says
the guy did it,

183
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,923
that usually means
the guy did it.

184
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,558
Thank you.
Everyone listen to Rosa.

185
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,592
No, I'm still
furious at you.

186
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,793
Okay, no one
listen to Rosa.

187
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,762
She's clearly an accomplice
to this crime.

188
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,731
I'm gonna go take
another crack at Whitman.

189
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,032
You've been in there,
like, five times.

190
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,100
What are you gonna do?

191
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,134
Annoy him into talking?

192
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,635
Ha, ha.

193
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,270
Two, three, four.

194
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,275
Aah!

195
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,716
Didn't work.

196
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,384
Thank you.
Did not work.

197
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,819
Hey, Captain.

198
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,186
Will you please
let everyone else go?

199
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,721
I feel bad
that I ruined their weekend,

200
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:39,290
and I can tell
they're pissed at me.

201
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,625
I mean, Charles hasn't tried
to high-five me all morning.

202
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,060
Yes, I've taken
the brunt of that.

203
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:45,729
Kitchen buds.

204
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,364
Are you sure
Whitman did it?

205
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,799
Yes, I'm positive.

206
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,201
Then the whole team stays.

207
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,403
We have a better shot
with everyone on it.

208
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,238
Fine, will you at least
tell Hitchcock to go home?

209
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,540
His mouth smells like
rotten trout milk.

210
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:57,708
Is there such a thing?

211
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,042
I'm just telling you
what it smells like.

212
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:00,511
Get out.

213
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,313
- Do you have the bank records?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,549
Good thing I didn't reschedule
my date for tonight.

215
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,350
We're never leaving here.

216
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,885
Well, maybe that's
a good thing, you know?

217
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,820
Saved you from another
lame Internet date

218
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:15,792
with some lame guy named dirk
or mar... garine.

219
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,494
He's not lame, okay?

220
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,895
He works
with a friend of mine.

221
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,263
He has a human name.

222
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,698
And I'm not telling you
what it is,

223
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,367
because you'll look him up
and make fun of him.

224
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,635
I can't believe you think
so little of me

225
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,837
that you would just
automatically assume...

226
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,372
Is it Luke Mueller?

227
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:30,807
How did you do that?

228
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,809
Well, you only have
one friend... Kylie.

229
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,277
And she has
seven male coworkers.

230
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,245
Goatee, goatee,
jaunty fedora,

231
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,214
profile pic is a sunset,

232
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,650
tasmanian devil tattoo,
goatee.

233
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:43,586
Leaving Luke
as the only viable option.

234
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:44,787
Well, he's nice,

235
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:47,323
and he uses proper
punctuation in texts.

236
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,092
- Dreamboat.
- And I wanted to go out with him.

237
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,760
All right. You know what?
Reschedule for tonight.

238
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,495
I promise I will get us
out of here in time.

239
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,230
Fine.
I'm holding you to that.

240
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:55,498
Where's he taking you?

241
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:57,266
Terrific, let's get
everyone involved.

242
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,134
Dinner and a movie.

243
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,938
Dinner and a movie
is the perfect first date.

244
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,840
I think the perfect first date
doesn't feel like

245
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,975
a first date at all,
because you've known each other

246
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,377
for a few years,
maybe even work together.

247
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:11,412
And one night
you're laughing,

248
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:13,414
and then all of a sudden,
it's just like blammo!

249
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,216
Kissing.

250
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,752
Cheap dinner,
watch basketball, bone down.

251
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:22,189
So pretty much the same
as what I said.

252
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,492
None of the partials
match Whitman.

253
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,194
If he did it,
he didn't leave any prints.

254
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,096
Maybe he doesn't have any.

255
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:30,430
Interesting fact
about me...

256
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:32,466
I once burnt my fingerprints off
on a wok.

257
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:35,135
Hi, hello.

258
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,436
What are you doing?

259
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,804
Holt said you didn't
have to come in here.

260
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,406
You don't come in on days
you're supposed to work.

261
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:42,309
Because I'm so nice,
I brought two pies.

262
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,144
One is from crust.

263
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:47,648
And one's also
from flatbush diner.

264
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,883
Hey, you know what
might be fun?

265
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:52,319
Charles could try them
and tell us which one is better.

266
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:53,587
How fun is that?

267
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,889
- So fun.
- Yay!

268
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,092
Yum, yum, yum.
Yummy.

269
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,094
You got a second, Captain?

270
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:04,299
I've got these overtime forms
for you to s...

271
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,736
Are you stifling a yawn?

272
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,805
- No, sir.
- Go home, sergeant.

273
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,006
I'm fine.

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,609
And I filled this out.
I just need you to...

275
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:21,649
Permission to yawn, sir.

276
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,318
Go home.

277
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,425
Please, I'm begging you.

278
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,294
- Oh, fair enough.
- Yeah.

279
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:36,363
That's for women.

280
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,901
- These your glasses?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:41,935
They're gigantic.

282
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:43,704
My contacts dried out,
thanks to you.

283
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:46,306
And they're cool.
No, they're not.

284
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:48,609
Wow, you are blind blind.

285
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,678
- Yeah.
- You're a blind cop.

286
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,246
How has there not been
a made-for-TV movie

287
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,115
about your struggles?
Give those back.

288
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:56,717
Yeah, okay.

289
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:58,853
Wait a minute.

290
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,354
I did it.

291
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,956
I got Whitman,
dead to rights.

292
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,092
I can still make my date?
As I promised.

293
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,593
Go get changed.

294
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:06,861
And by that,
of course I mean

295
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,129
throw your glasses
in the garbage,

296
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,597
then get laser surgery,

297
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,067
then recuperate...
And she left the room.

298
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,271
It's all right.
6 out of 12.

299
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:17,505
Out of 12? Why?

300
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,540
For the 12 components
of food satisfaction:

301
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,178
Salty, sweet, sour,
bitter, umami, odor, sound...

302
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,013
Sound?
Come on, Charles.

303
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:27,715
Try her nasty pie.

304
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,120
Oh, wow.

305
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,721
That's the best pie
I ever had.

306
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,823
No, no.

307
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,224
- No, no, no.
- What's this?

308
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,727
We were running calls
to pawn shops

309
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,029
and then waiting for them
to call back.

310
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,964
I didn't ask
what you were doing.

311
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:45,899
I asked
what you are doing.

312
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,435
Pie taste test, it's over.
I won.

313
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,769
That's unacceptable.

314
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,538
If you wanna know which
restaurant has better pies,

315
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:56,175
you can't just have one guy
try one pie from each place.

316
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:58,377
Everybody needs to try

317
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:01,514
all the pies
from both places.

318
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:05,184
We gonna be here awhile.

319
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:06,953
Debit card statement.

320
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,121
You were at a parking meter

321
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:09,355
two blocks
from the jewelry store

322
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,324
an hour before the robbery.

323
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:15,595
Oh, no, you found out...
About my wife.

324
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,997
We both have cards, because
we share a joint account,

325
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,332
because we love each other.

326
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,233
You're incapable of love,
and I'll prove it!

327
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:22,434
Oh, I'm very tired.

328
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,270
I want my lawyer, now.

329
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:26,873
Ugh!

330
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,008
You have changed.

331
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:29,843
You used to go
straight to prison!

332
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,711
Did Whitman talk?

333
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,780
Oh, he talked all right.

334
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,115
He asked for his lawyer.

335
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,885
By using words,
which is technically talking.

336
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
We can't ask him
any more questions

337
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,455
till we find his lawyer,

338
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,956
and we can't find
his lawyer anywhere.

339
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:44,725
I'm sorry.

340
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,093
Aah, come on.

341
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,794
Why is there pie here?

342
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:50,063
That's not good.

343
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,298
I think the world of you,

344
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,600
as a colleague
and friend.

345
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,901
- Shut up, Peralta.
-  Yep.

346
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,027
- Yes!
- Another one for crust.

347
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,230
It's not looking good
for flatbush diner.

348
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:01,965
Ah, come on!

349
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,033
You went home and showered?

350
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,434
That's so unfair.

351
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:06,836
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Oh, cool.

352
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,138
Hey, can I borrow it?

353
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,040
Uh, why do you wanna
borrow the toothbrush?

354
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,041
What possible answer
could he give

355
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,275
that would make you say yes?

356
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:13,343
I wanna brush my teeth.

357
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,978
Jake, it's been
in my mouth.

358
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:16,346
That's the grossest thing
I've ever heard.

359
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,414
That's the grossest thing
you've ever heard?

360
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,682
You caught a guy
on the subway

361
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,417
with a bag of human ears.

362
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:21,652
Your thing's grosser.

363
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:22,853
Bring out the meringues.

364
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:25,556
I brought a few more.
That's so many.

365
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:28,532
You wanted something, sir?

366
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,428
Look, it's impossible
to make you leave.

367
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:33,364
But you do have to sleep,
and that's an order.

368
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,001
Sir, this is not necessary.

369
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:39,104
Also, can't sleep
without my whale songs.

370
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,672
Terry, I've seen this before.

371
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,441
Problems at home,
so you stay late at the job,

372
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,976
but that only
makes it worse.

373
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,145
Everything's great
with my wife.

374
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,014
It's just,
my brother-in-law's in town,

375
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:51,850
and we do not get along.

376
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,419
- He thinks I'm a weakling.
- You?

377
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,823
Let me get that for you.

378
00:13:57,824 --> 00:14:00,258
I can do it.

379
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,128
Tiny Terry
loves his pickles.

380
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,030
He makes me feel so small.

381
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,732
Who cares what he thinks?

382
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,535
You're a police sergeant.
You're a grown man.

383
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,170
Now take your nap.

384
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,405
And if I see
the lights on in here,

385
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:16,241
I'm gonna be
very disappointed in you.

386
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,979
Are you the idiot that made
a Friday night arrest?

387
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,581
I was in the poconos
with my wife.

388
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:23,882
You ruined
my entire weekend.

389
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,752
Get in line, because
that's their attitude.

390
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,354
Get your own attitude.

391
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,424
He has an alibi, geniuses.
He was at torque.

392
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,966
It's a nightclub in cape may,
New Jersey, all night.

393
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:34,994
Nice try.

394
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,362
You think I'm gonna
waste six hours

395
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,931
driving to the Jersey Shore
and back on some fake alibi?

396
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,232
It's up to you.

397
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,468
But in ten hours,
he walks.

398
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:48,507
More like in ten hours,
he walks into prison,

399
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:49,708
when we bust him.

400
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:51,210
Let's follow up
on his alibi.

401
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,479
- Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road.
- No.

402
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,713
You should've looked
into this

403
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:56,715
before you made the arrest.
You go.

404
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,816
Oh, Captain,
I'm happy to go.

405
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,252
I love the saltwater taffy
down there.

406
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,586
Scully loves
the saltwater taffy down there.

407
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,955
No, Peralta's going.
Go, Peralta.

408
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,257
Look, I know I caused
this problem, but I can fix it.

409
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:06,926
We just got
some new security footage in.

410
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,288
Let me stay here
and go through it.

411
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:10,429
I'm gonna prove that Whitman
was at the scene of the crime,

412
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,298
even if it kills me.

413
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,200
This is killing me.

414
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,768
Good. Die.

415
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,838
You know,
if it does come to that,

416
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,576
I have but one wish
before I go.

417
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,111
Can I please put your glasses
on my penis?

418
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:28,181
I just think
that would be really funny.

419
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,416
Hey,
can you make copies

420
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,617
of these warrant requests
for me?

421
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:33,252
I'm not your secretary.

422
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,887
You're everyone's secretary.

423
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,656
That's literally your job.

424
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:39,058
And your job is lying
about your taste buds?

425
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,861
I'm sorry about
the whole pie blowup thing.

426
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:42,962
You're right.

427
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,797
The flatbush diner pie
is awful.

428
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:48,168
- Thank you.
- It's just...

429
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:49,836
I want Rosa to like me.

430
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:52,106
All right,
do whatever you want,

431
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,242
but most women
don't really like it

432
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,945
when dudes lie to them.

433
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,181
Except for me,
but I'm wired

434
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:02,084
to thrive on dysfunction.

435
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,619
Nothing.

436
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,521
Wait, wait, wait. This guy...
5'9 " or 5'10",

437
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:08,689
black knit cap.

438
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:10,177
Come on, come on, come on.

439
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:11,846
Gotcha!

440
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,229
Ugh, it's not him.

441
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:18,499
Let's just arrest this guy.
Who even cares anymore?

442
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,002
So how'd my new best friend
Luke take it

443
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,203
when you
cancelled on him again?

444
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:25,539
Don't know,
hasn't called me back.

445
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,907
Which is
what always happens,

446
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:29,944
because it's impossible
to be a cop and date.

447
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:33,147
Amy, look.
There is a guy out there

448
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,015
with incredibly low standards

449
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,385
and a super weird
soul patch,

450
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,387
and he is waiting for you.

451
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,491
Amy, my patch
tingles for you.

452
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:46,494
We will wed on the isle
of New Jersey.

453
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:48,629
Our first dance will be
to jessie's girl,

454
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,331
because my name
is definitely jessie.

455
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:52,700
- It's so romantic.
- Hey, guys.

456
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:53,934
Hey.

457
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:56,270
Yeah, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

458
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:59,940
The bad news is my saltwater
taffy place was closed.

459
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:01,240
And the good news?

460
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:02,741
Whitman's alibi
checked out.

461
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,711
Security footage from torque
shows he was there.

462
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,380
That's not good news.

463
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:10,516
- That's bad news.
- Right. That is bad news.

464
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,618
Sorry, it's on me.

465
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,486
No, Detective Scully,
it's on Peralta.

466
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:18,290
No, Captain,
that's on Santiago.

467
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,358
It's on me.
It's still on me.

468
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,895
This is such a disaster.

469
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,297
It's not good.
D.A.'s furious.

470
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:28,033
Whitman and his lawyer
are in my office right now,

471
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:30,502
gunning for a lawsuit.
No, not that.

472
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,771
My brother-in-law is coming
to have dinner with me

473
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:35,440
on his way to jfk.

474
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:41,480
But also the botched
investigation, that's bad too.

475
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:45,283
Okay, what can I do?

476
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,453
Oh, your services
will not be necessary,

477
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:50,822
because you need to go home
and change for your date.

478
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,757
- What?
- I called handsome Luke.

479
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,326
I explained the weekend
was entirely

480
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:55,660
my fault, partially.

481
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,062
And he wants to go out
with you tonight.

482
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:59,665
- Thanks, Peralta.
- You're welcome.

483
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,800
Just promise me you won't
use the condoms

484
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,234
in the secret pocket
of your purse, okay?

485
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,203
- They're expired.
- How do you know what's in my purse?

486
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:06,005
I needed concealer
for a zit.

487
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,341
Plus, you know, we spend
so much time together here,

488
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:11,343
I know everything
about everyone.

489
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:14,146
I know Hitchcock
went bald at 15.

490
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:16,214
Scully used to date
Hitchcock's wife.

491
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,450
Charles has a bike with
a little basket on the front.

492
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:20,051
How else would you
carry baguettes?

493
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,621
And Rosa has a shower
in her apartment, I think.

494
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,089
I got nothing on her.

495
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,223
Good.

496
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:27,459
Well, I guess we did
just spend 48 hours

497
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,396
locked in here together.

498
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,600
Holy crap.

499
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:36,402
- What?
- Locked in here together.

500
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:38,471
So we will be filing
a wrongful arrest suit

501
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,272
against the NYPD.

502
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:43,709
And when I win,
I'm gonna buy club torque,

503
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,810
put a statue of Jake Peralta

504
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,212
right in the middle
of the dance floor.

505
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,314
First off,
that's a terrible threat.

506
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:49,749
I would love to have
a statue of myself

507
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,083
in the middle
of a dance club.

508
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,384
Second...

509
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,819
Do me a favor,
take a look at this picture,

510
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,020
and tell me what you see.

511
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:56,923
You and Regis philbin.

512
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,124
Awesome, right?

513
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,459
Surprisingly
down-to-earth guy

514
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,227
and definitely not the picture
I meant to show you.

515
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,796
But take a look at this.

516
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:06,033
That's right, it's you and
your old cell mate Marcus Cole.

517
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,270
And here he is again
outside the jewelry store.

518
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,005
The two of you planned this
together in prison.

519
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,407
You taught him your m.O,

520
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,741
he pulled off the robbery,

521
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,511
you got yourself an alibi,
and you split the loot.

522
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:19,180
Oh, man, I can't believe
he caught us.

523
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,415
Of course he did,

524
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,616
Peralta is the best!

525
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,384
Aw, thanks, reg.
That's enough.

526
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,652
Yeah, I gotta work
on my Regis.

527
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:25,987
Anyway, see ya in jail,
Whitman.

528
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,456
You got anything else
to say?

529
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,828
Hey, Rosa, the flatbush diner's
pie is terrible.

530
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,096
It's inedible.

531
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,564
Food is supposed
to be edible.

532
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,699
So you were lying?

533
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,135
What the hell, Boyle?

534
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,471
Put it
in the suck-it bucket.

535
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,539
Crust isn't any better.

536
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:46,275
It's fancier, but it's
all bells and whistles.

537
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,811
Desserts don't need
to be clever.

538
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,580
They just need to be good.

539
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:54,317
This is the best pie
in New York City...

540
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:59,356
Apple from argos bakery,
founded 1910.

541
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,526
Recipe unchanged.
Taste it.

542
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,965
Damn, it is amazing.

543
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,766
This pie is so good,
I hate it.

544
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,568
You just graduated
pie school, bitches.

545
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:14,171
Sorry I said "bitches,"
I'm just really worked up.

546
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,073
Yow!
Mmm, what is that?

547
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:19,076
Sorry for screwing up
everyone's weekend.

548
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:22,780
Hey, uh, drinks on me.
Who's in?

549
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,248
Oh, no way.
No, I got the date. I gotta change.

550
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:26,651
- Come on.
- Everyone's tired, Peralta.

551
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,019
They just wanna go home.

552
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,720
Yeah, but I have to prove
I'm not selfish,

553
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:30,922
so I don't care
what they want.

554
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,124
That sounded bad.

555
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,027
And to make up
for what I did, I'll cover

556
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,061
one shift each
for all of you.

557
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,363
No kidding?

558
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,798
- Except Santiago.
- What?

559
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,999
I got you your date back.

560
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,169
One nice thing from me
is all you get.

561
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,438
So this is my desk.

562
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:48,739
Desk jockey, huh?

563
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,142
You just sit here,
eat your pickles,

564
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,877
wait for the criminals
to turn themselves in.

565
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,412
Actually, I don't like
pickles that much.

566
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:55,913
Terry, I'm glad
I found you.

567
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,015
There's been a development
in the Russian mob case.

568
00:20:58,016 --> 00:20:59,417
Oh?
Yeah, our killer

569
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:00,651
has been spotted
in the warehouse

570
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:02,319
down by the canal.
Get your gear.

571
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,321
So you want me first
through the door, sir?

572
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:05,490
Oh, it's just you.

573
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,225
The SWAT team
is on another call,

574
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,427
so you'll have
to do it alone.

575
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:11,530
Hey, I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

576
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,699
Hey, no, do your thing,
do your thing.

577
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,034
Go, Terry.

578
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,505
You can crash
on my couch.

579
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:21,265
I even downloaded you
some whale songs.

580
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,854
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget it.

581
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,517
Good night, Terry.

582
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,505

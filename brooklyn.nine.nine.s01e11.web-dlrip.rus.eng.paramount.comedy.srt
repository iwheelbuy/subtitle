1
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:05,988
Al right, you'll take this one
on the right,

2
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:08,523
and I'll take the big one
on the left.

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,360
NYPD!
Santa, stop hitting Santa.

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:12,661
What's going on here?

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,029
I've been on this corner
for six years.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,864
Suddenly, this guy shows up.

7
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,132
<i>Hey, you don't own
this corner. I got a charity too.</i>

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,534
Canine diabetes?
Who cares about fat dogs?

9
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,570
They can't give themselves
shots, they got paws.

10
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,771
All right.
Calm down, calm down.

11
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,640
<i>Boyle, frisk the skinny one.</i>

12
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,041
I've gone 42 years
without a lump of coal.

13
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,542
I'm not gonna start now.

14
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:28,944
Are you kidding me?

15
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,078
All right, fine.
Come here, buddy.

16
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:34,416
Hey, hey, hey!

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,086
Hit him in his fat
cherry cheeks.

18
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,888
Ooh!

19
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,123
Ugh, that felt wrong.

20
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,157
<i>Knife!</i>

21
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,692
Skinny Santa's got a knife!

22
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,160
Ahh!

23
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:46,328
That's right. Boom!

24
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,729
Just kicked Santa
in the testicles.

25
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,602
Merry Christmas.

26
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,396

27
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,925
Looking good.
Happy Hanukkah.

28
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,427
You look happy.

29
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,561
Let me guess.

30
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:20,729
Your egg sandwich fell
on the floor

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,997
and they gave it to you
for free.

32
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,432
No. Can you do that?

33
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,966
Why doesn't everyone just drop
their sandwiches on the floor?

34
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,402
I was trying to insult you.

35
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,405
And instead, you gave me
an amazing life hack.

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,042
Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have.
But this is embarrassing.

37
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,811
I didn't get you a present.

38
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,312
The gift is for Captain Holt.

39
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,780
It's one of six presents
I got him

40
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,349
representing the six lessons
that he's taught me:

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,352
Determination, wisdom,
posture...

42
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,754
Excuse me, everyone.

43
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:47,489
As you may know,
this is the holiday season.

44
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:49,691
<i>Detectives sometimes
feel the urge</i>

45
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,793
<i>to buy their captains
holiday presents.</i>

46
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:53,462
Please refrain
from doing so.

47
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,063
<i>Under no circumstances</i>

48
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,532
do I want a present.

49
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,868
<i>Peralta, my office.</i>

50
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,103
<i>Roger that!</i>

51
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,604
Oh, my God, I have to return
so many items.

52
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,772
I know.

53
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:05,073
Shut up.

54
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,475
<i>Thank you for joining us,
Peralta.</i>

55
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,843
This is deputy chief Gerber.

56
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,144
Ah, merry Christmas, chief.

57
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,713
And a very merry Christmas
to you, Captain.

58
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,081
Ho, ho, ho!

59
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,583
<i>Captain Holt has received</i>

60
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,184
a number of death threats.

61
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,452
Oh.

62
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,254
I really came in here
with the wrong energy.

63
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,523
Captains receive meaningless
threats all the time.

64
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,391
It's really no big deal.

65
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:24,659
Of course, totally.

66
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,194
I mean, why would a death threat
be a big deal?

67
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:27,696
Oh, that's right.
'Cause it threatens death.

68
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,830
It's a hoax.

69
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,165
I didn't wanna alarm the squad.

70
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,833
So, please,
keep this between us.

71
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:34,669
Awesome.
I'm great at secrets.

72
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,605
Santiago got you
like six presents.

73
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,808
Well, it may be a hoax,
but protocol dictates

74
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,276
that Captain Holt
have a security detail with him

75
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,711
at all times.

76
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,513
He's chosen you
for that detail.

77
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,847
Interesting.

78
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,350
And not at all surprising.
I'm his favorite.

79
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,452
Tell me, what would
this job entail?

80
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,521
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt.
Uh-huh.

81
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,790
You'll be entirely in control
of his movements. Amazing.

82
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,825
He will not leave your sight.

83
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,727
You have the authority
to make decisions that you feel

84
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,162
are in the best interest
of his safety.

85
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,496
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,198
Basically you'll be
completely in charge.

87
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:04,533
Oh, well, it sounds
really tough,

88
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:05,934
but of course I accept,

89
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,336
and I will be willing to put
my life at risk for this man

90
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:09,671
to have to follow
all of my orders.

91
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,106
Thank you!
This is the best Christmas ever.

92
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,774
God bless us, everyone!

93
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,977
Hey, my flight
is at 8:00 tonight.

94
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,579
It's domestic.

95
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,081
You think I'll be safe if I get
to the airport five hours early?

96
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,817
Five?
No way!

97
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:23,552
You gotta do seven.
Seven minimum.

98
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,920
Seven. I knew it.
Yep.

99
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,788
Why are you going
on a singles cruise?

100
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,956
I thought
you were into Rosa.

101
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,424
Well, I am.

102
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,760
But I've begun to feel
like there's a slight chance

103
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,461
Rosa may not love me back.

104
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,030
Hey, how about we grab
some dinner tonight,

105
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,198
just you and me?

106
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,200
That's nice,
and I like you as a person,

107
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,801
but I'm just not interested
in you...

108
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,369
Romantically.

109
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,571
Coolio!

110
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,739
Hey, what say you
we grab a drink?

111
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,174
You're starting
to make this weird.

112
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,243
I'm not into you that way,
and I have a boyfriend.

113
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:50,188
Got you.
Rain check.

114
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,214
A rose... for Rosa.

115
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,448
Listen to me!

116
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,751
The healthy thing for you
to do is move on.

117
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:59,421
So we both decided
the healthy thing for me to do

118
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,257
is to just move on.

119
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,092
I'm impressed, Charles.
That's very mature.

120
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,360
Thanks.
You know what's funny?

121
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,696
I realized I sometimes...
Oh, no, don't get comfy.

122
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,370
This wasn't an invitation
to keep talking.

123
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:10,665
Gotcha.
Rain check on the convo.

124
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,434
Yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.

125
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,502
Peralta's busy,
so let's just get started.

126
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,304
<i>Now, the Captain won't allow us
to give him</i>

127
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,639
all the presents
we bought him.

128
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,908
You are the only one
that did that.

129
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:23,945
But we can make him the greatest
Christmas card of all time.

130
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,748
We're gonna Santa hats
and big sweaters

131
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:27,916
and take a picture of us all
in a lineup.

132
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,150
<i>I'm sorry, Santiago,</i>

133
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,485
but I don't have time
for that.

134
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,187
My psych evaluation is today.

135
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,455
They're gonna decide
if I'm ready

136
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:34,556
to make it back
on the streets.

137
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:35,757
Why do you care
what they think?

138
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:36,992
Psychologists are just people

139
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,793
who weren't smart enough
to be psychics.

140
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:41,129
<i>Don't worry, sergeant.
We'll add you in later.</i>

141
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,433
Sorry, I gotta go too.
My flight is in...

142
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:46,835
Ah, eight hours.

143
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,003
I can make it.

144
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,037
I'll buy a sandwich
on the plane.

145
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,572
Boyle!

146
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,574
So if Peralta, Boyle,
and the sergeant are out...

147
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,075
Fine, everyone just go.

148
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,744
Yeah.

149
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:59,414
I could take a pic of myself
dressed up as an elf.

150
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,082
Elfie-selfie.

151
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,084
Not that...

152
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,553
But I think there is something
you could help me with.

153
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,824
You gonna sit there
all day?

154
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,159
Affirmative, stone eagle.

155
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,962
That's the Secret Service
codename I gave you.

156
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,530
Just sitting here
doing my job,

157
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,866
watching, protecting,
bossing you around.

158
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,134
Now, for your safety,

159
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,302
if you could open up
your Internet browser

160
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,603
and search the words
"pigs" and "jet skis,"

161
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:22,971
and that's an order.

162
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going, Cold Mountain?

163
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,008
I changed your codename.

164
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,510
To use the restroom.

165
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,312
I'm only asking this
for your safety.

166
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:32,747
Is it a number one
or a number two?

167
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,183
Your silence indicates
number two.

168
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,185
Let me do some recon.

169
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,290
It's all clear, sir.

170
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,060
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go,

171
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:49,664
go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

172
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,032
Cold Mountain
is on the move.

173
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,969
I repeat, Cold Mountain
is rolling to the can.

174
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,339
Sergeant Jeffords,
thank you for coming in today.

175
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,042
We are here to assess
your readiness for active duty,

176
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,646
and if all goes
I will stamp this release form,

177
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,147
you can go
back in the field.

178
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,016
Well, I think I'm ready.

179
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:11,186
I am no longer fixating
on my fears, ha.

180
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,255
Good. But for today,
let's... fixate on those fears.

181
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,926
Okay.
Um...

182
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,361
That sounds fun.

183
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,297
<i>Let's begin by talking
about your baby girls</i>

184
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,566
and your wife,

185
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,735
and what would happen to them
if you died...

186
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,703
In the line of duty.

187
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,040
I popped your pillow.

188
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,419
<i>Captain...</i>

189
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,454
Where do you think
you're going?

190
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,256
I'm going home
to work in peace.

191
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,959
That's a negative, ice veins.
Changed your codename again.

192
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,661
Do you know why I chose you
to be my security escort?

193
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,363
Because I'm a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes?

194
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,665
No, I chose you
because the threat is not real.

195
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,234
Mm-hmm.

196
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,935
And I thought you'd have
no problem breaking the rules

197
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,470
and letting me
get my work done.

198
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,938
Now... let me go.

199
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,440
Well, you thought wrong.

200
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,208
You can't go home.
It's protocol.

201
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,943
But if you really wanna
get outta here,

202
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,745
you can come to my mom's.

203
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,313
She lives nearby.

204
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,481
Or I can lock you up
in the holding cell

205
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,649
with an armed escort.

206
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,884
Totally your call.

207
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,453
Fine. We will go
to your mother's house.

208
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,555
I guess I am curious
to see where...

209
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,390
This all started.

210
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,459
Shotgun.

211
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,629
So... this is my mom's place.

212
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,267
You can just throw your jacket
in the closet.

213
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,501
That's a bathroom.

214
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,804
Water closet.
My mom's British.

215
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,572
Hmm.

216
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:38,973
Why are there
no photographs of you?

217
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,476
No holiday decorations.

218
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,545
Nothing but...

219
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,181
Motel art.

220
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,250
This isn't
your mom's apartment.

221
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:52,187
It's a safe house, son!
You've been protected.

222
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,122
Don't say "son."

223
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,723
Get outta my way.

224
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,058
Look, you wouldn't stay
at your desk

225
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,393
and you evaded
your protection detail.

226
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,228
I'm sorry, but I've gotta
order you to stay.

227
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,729
I love giving you orders.

228
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,064
The only way you're gonna
keep me here

229
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,466
is if you physically stop me.

230
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,567
Can you do that, Peralta?

231
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,671
I didn't think so.

232
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:11,806
Jordan.
Ahh!

233
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,141
<i>Oh, no.</i>

234
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,510
We're handcuffed together
and we've lost the key.

235
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:18,012
Falconer one to HQ,
stone eagle is in the cage.

236
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,315
I repeat,
stone eagle is in the cage.

237
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:29,298
I told you the death threat
was not serious.

238
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,567
So what on earth
are you doing?

239
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,602
Look, I know you think
that I'm just goofing around,

240
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,871
but I got a direct order
from your boss

241
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:37,306
to protect you.

242
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,874
So from this point forward,
we're on lockdown.

243
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,809
Fine. But before we go
into lockdown...

244
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,144
Too late.
You're on it.

245
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,345
I'd like to text my husband

246
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,580
and tell him I'll be
coming home late tonight.

247
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,014
<i>All right,
but for security reasons,</i>

248
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,316
I get to craft the message.

249
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,218
Let's start
with a pleasant greeting.

250
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,719
How about...
"Hello, honey."

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,354
You will not craft
the message.

252
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:54,022
Okay, Roger that.
"Honey's" wrong.

253
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:55,624
How about "hello, husband"?

254
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:56,925
How about "hello, sir"?

255
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,394
You call each other "sir"?
Give me my phone.

256
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:02,030
Fine.

257
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:04,233
I'll give you some privacy.

258
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,637
Maybe put Hitchcock's head
on top like an angel.

259
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,738
Mm.

260
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,807
<i>Like that?</i>

261
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,609
No, put it behind the tree.

262
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,110
<i>Thanks for helping
me make this card.</i>

263
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:16,411
You're so good
at this stuff.

264
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,647
I know.
I'm good at everything.

265
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:20,916
All right, so here's
all the pictures of Rosa

266
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,117
that we have.

267
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,752
<i>Which one should we use?</i>

268
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:26,655
She never smiles.
Is her mouth broken?

269
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,657
Well, what about if we...

270
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:31,362
<i>Flip those lips?</i>

271
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:32,794
Oh, God.
Oof!

272
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,296
<i>That's horrifying.</i>

273
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,531
We have to get a picture
of Rosa smiling.

274
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,666
<i>Holt's card
has to be perfect.</i>

275
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,501
Guys... I got this.

276
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,370
<i>I can make Rosa smile.</i>

277
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,272
Just keep your cameras ready.

278
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,875
Making coffee?

279
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,213
<i>Can you make another cup</i>

280
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:51,113
for senor tickle
and his nueve amigos?

281
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:52,414
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

282
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:55,887
What the hell, Hitchcock?
Ow, ahh! Ow, ow, ow!

283
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,486
I think you sprained
senor tickle.

284
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,688
Next time, I break it off.

285
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,691
<i>Ow!</i>

286
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,527
All right.

287
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,196
My safe house,
my rules.

288
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:10,933
This is a no tie zone.

289
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,902
A hungry safe house
is an unsafe safe house.

290
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:18,407
A fun safe house
is a safe safe house.

291
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,142
My serve.

292
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,377
Ah.

293
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,380
I thought you said
you've never played this.

294
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,380
It's very intuitive.

295
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,150
Let's have another sandwich.

296
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:29,885
A <i>safe house-</i> watching
safe house

297
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:32,120
is a safe safe house house.

298
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,455
I've already seen the film.

299
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:34,756
I enjoyed it.

300
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,158
Wow, I would not
have guessed that.

301
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,826
You see, those are the kind
of things that you learn

302
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,228
when you're handcuffed
together.

303
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,796
And that is the true meaning
of Christmas.

304
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,632
Who knows we're here?

305
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,602
Get behind me.

306
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,036
No, no!
Going over!

307
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,372
Standard protocol suggests
that you put me in another room

308
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:51,940
before you open the door.

309
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,108
But since you've cuffed us
together...

310
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,243
I order you to be quiet.

311
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:55,644
Come on.

312
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:01,183
Freeze, sicko!
Ah!

313
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,951
Jake, it's me,
Charles from work.

314
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:08,257
Okay, let's switch gears,
do a little word association.

315
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,992
<i>What do you think of</i>

316
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,360
when I say the word "bottle"?

317
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:15,964
Liquor store, holdup,
gun, die.

318
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,165
How about "grass"?

319
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,369
Marijuana, drugs.

320
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,437
Gun, die.

321
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,505
Cat.

322
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,107
Kitten.

323
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,208
Cute.

324
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,844
<i>Calm.
False sense of security.</i>

325
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,646
Gun, die.

326
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,081
<i>What are you doing?</i>

327
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,783
You gonna stamp my form?

328
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:39,788
No. I just didn't want the ink
to dry out.

329
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:42,691
Boyle, what are you
doing here?

330
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:43,992
I thought you had
to catch a flight.

331
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,994
I do.
My flight is in six hours.

332
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,396
But the Captain
texted me to come,

333
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,664
so I'm here.
What?

334
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:50,065
You texted Boyle
when you told me

335
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,366
you were texting
your husband?

336
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,502
As the person who's completely
in charge here,

337
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:55,704
I am <i>very</i> disappointed
in you.

338
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:58,540
I'm changing your codename
to "bad boy."

339
00:11:58,574 --> 00:11:59,941
Oh, I can't imagine
what it's like

340
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,877
to be disappointed at
someone under your command.

341
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:04,546
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Tushy.

342
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,548
It's touche.

343
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,050
Well, I'm in charge,
and I say it's tushy.

344
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,050
Boyle?

345
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,352
I've heard it both ways.

346
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:11,687
Please don't involve me
in this.

347
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:12,888
I'm just here
to uncuff the Captain

348
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,189
and take him
to his old precinct.

349
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,390
What?

350
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:16,992
Old precinct?
Wait a minute.

351
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,660
You weren't going home
at all.

352
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,395
You were going
to investigate the threat

353
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,997
because it's not a hoax,
it's real!

354
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,066
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!

355
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,300
You have a tell.

356
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:27,035
When you lie,
the corner of your mouth moves,

357
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,236
and it just moved.

358
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:29,838
Wrong, it's not real.

359
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:30,939
You're lying!

360
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,274
Fine.

361
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,608
I believe the threat is real,

362
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:35,210
though I'm not sure
who's behind it.

363
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,878
But this is my problem,

364
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,280
and I'm gonna solve it
on my own.

365
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,681
Boyle, uncuff me.
Don't do it, Charles.

366
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,183
I'll take you on that trip
to the botanical gardens

367
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:42,884
we've always talked about.

368
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,219
Uncuff me,
and that's a direct order.

369
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,721
Don't do it, best friend.
Botanical gardens.

370
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:48,156
Ah! This is just like Christmas
at my parents' house.

371
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,825
Why do they have
separate dining rooms?

372
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:52,728
I...

373
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,464
No!

374
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,199
<i>That was not
one of the options!</i>

375
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,967
I couldn't choose,
I love you both so much.

376
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,137
Who wants to watch <i>safe house?</i>

377
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,743
So, including letters, e-mails,
and texts from a blocked phone,

378
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,411
we have received
ten threats.

379
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:11,913
How many people
have you put away

380
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:13,180
that might want you dead?

381
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,515
I've arrested
over 600 people.

382
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,716
Brag.

383
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:17,018
Boyle, will you please
read the transcripts

384
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,352
<i>of the threats
he's received?</i>

385
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,554
Yup.

386
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,556
"Die, die, die."
"Die, Holt, die."

387
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,257
Okay, a little obvious.

388
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,792
"You will drown
in your own blood."

389
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,193
<i>Better.</i>

390
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:27,562
Although I would've gone
with the whole,

391
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,030
"I'm gonna staple my face
onto your face" thing.

392
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:31,532
Human skin mask.
Classic.

393
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,135
The next one is "I'm gonna
send you off the deep end."

394
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,170
"Drowning" and "deep end."

395
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:38,372
Almost sounds like he's talking
about a swimming pool.

396
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,074
It's Haimes.

397
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,375
Aha!
Who's Haimes?

398
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,145
Colin Haimes,
the freestyle killer.

399
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:48,015
He took out an entire 4x100
meter relay swim team in 1982.

400
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:51,819
Marco.

401
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:56,924
Now you say "polo," punk.

402
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,459
The freestyle killer.

403
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,161
Man! How come
all the killers you've caught

404
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:01,629
had such cool names?

405
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,231
The best name I ever brought in
was "narrow shoes" Sam,

406
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,900
because... his shoes were
narrow and his name was Sam.

407
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,768
I get it.
Yeah, you get it.

408
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,738
Well, Captain, it looks like
you needed our help after all.

409
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,406
Together, we figured out
it was Haimes,

410
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,041
and together,
we're gonna take him down.

411
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,110
Because together,
we can do anything.

412
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,812
Here we go!

413
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,781
I'm finding Haimes
<i>alone.</i>

414
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,385
Coming back at you, Jake!

415
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:28,823
Oh, my God, Rosa!

416
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,191
I accidentally
opened your mail,

417
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:31,258
but look what it says.

418
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:34,228
"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."

419
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,563
Rosa, guess what.

420
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:37,031
I accidentally
opened your mail,

421
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:38,232
and here's what it says.

422
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,834
<i>"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."</i>

423
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,602
No, I'm reading the letter,
and you're taking the picture.

424
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:42,603
What?

425
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,005
Ha!

426
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,339
You were trying to get me
to smile for your dumb picture,

427
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,274
but you messed up.

428
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,143
Ah! She smiled.
She's smiling!

429
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:51,045
And no one has a camera.

430
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,580
Got it, Amy.

431
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,981
Got a picture
of you frowning.

432
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,216
That's what you wanted,
right?

433
00:14:58,186 --> 00:14:59,387
Peralta,
for the last time

434
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:00,521
we don't have to go back
to the precinct.

435
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:01,689
I don't need
everyone's help.

436
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,557
Look, Captain,
you're stubborn.

437
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,992
And that's
an adorable quality.

438
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,161
You wanna know what's not
an adorable quality?

439
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:08,295
Being dead.
Acne.

440
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,497
Yep, being dead.

441
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,564
I mean, I give up.

442
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,732
What's going on with you?

443
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:12,967
Why are you being
so weird about this?

444
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:14,235
I don't need your help.

445
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:17,438
I don't wanna involve you,
or Boyle, or anyone.

446
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,040
Because I brought
this situation on myself.

447
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:22,009
No one should get hurt
because of a dumb mistake I made

448
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,744
as a brash, young Detective.

449
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,146
Hey, Haimes.

450
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,514
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life

451
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:29,250
in a little cement room,
doing nothing.

452
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:32,186
And while you're in there,
I'm gonna go for a swim.

453
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,157
And after that swim,
I might take another swim.

454
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,825
And you'll just be
sitting there

455
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:40,928
on your metal toilet,

456
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:44,865
thinking of me
swim, swim, swimming

457
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:47,234
all day long.

458
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,602
When I get out of lockup,

459
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,871
I'm gonna hunt you down
and kill you.

460
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,807
Yeah.

461
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,075
Right.

462
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,576
Wow.

463
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:56,944
I think I really would've gotten
along with young Ray Holt.

464
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,012
Yes, that's why I decided

465
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,714
to change everything
about my life.

466
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,415
Well, frankly, sir,
you're still acting

467
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,883
like that brash,
dumb Detective.

468
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,119
If you had truly changed,
you'd be saying

469
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:07,088
a bunch of boring,
responsible stuff, like...

470
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,456
"Don't be stupid.

471
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,357
"Use the Detective squad.
You're part of a team.

472
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,625
I smell like sandalwood."

473
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,127
That's what it is!

474
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,362
Yet another terrible impression,
Peralta.

475
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:16,764
But I think you're right.

476
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,499
Wait, what?

477
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,635
Sir, I'm sure
you had your reasons

478
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:23,304
for going to Peralta,
but...

479
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:26,040
This is exactly the type of job
I would love to have.

480
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:28,309
Okay, the next time someone
threatens to kill me,

481
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,610
I'll come straight to you.

482
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,278
Thank you, sir.

483
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,347
I can't wait.

484
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:36,650
I... didn't mean...

485
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,919
Let's catch this bastard.

486
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,389
All right, let's go!
Updates. Santiago.

487
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,325
Looking into Haimes' associates.
Nothing yet.

488
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,260
Boyle?

489
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,795
Uh, some intel coming in
from ossining.

490
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,396
Haimes was released
two weeks ago.

491
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,566
Good. Hitchcock and Scully,
update on your secret project?

492
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,068
Hazelnut coffee'll be up
in five minutes.

493
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:55,569
Sumatran's ready to go.

494
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:56,737
Keep me updated.

495
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:57,905
Warrant for the phone trace
came through.

496
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,206
We got Haimes' number...

497
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,175
And the last coordinates
from its GPS.

498
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,810
The rail yards.

499
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:05,980
All right, we got him.
Everyone suit up!

500
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,848
I know there's no point
in telling you not to come,

501
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:09,350
but while we're out there,
you're sticking with me.

502
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:10,651
Oh. Goodie.

503
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,686
Man, you really know
how to take the fun

504
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,854
out of saving your life.

505
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,589
You heard him, Hitchcock.

506
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,191
Get that Sumatran
in the thermos.

507
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,193
I'm on it.

508
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:27,835
If things go south,
I just want you to know

509
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,204
it's been an honor
being able to boss you around.

510
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:31,806
Anything else?

511
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:35,075
Yes. What cute little nickname
do you call your husband?

512
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:36,811
Kevin.

513
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,546
Adorable.

514
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,582
Sorry you
missed your flight.

515
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,119
I have a backup flight
in four hours.

516
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,152
Gotta flush him out.

517
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,659
We got his number now.
Call his phone.

518
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,361
Smart.

519
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,933
It's ringing.

520
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,435
This is exciting.

521
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:07,208
That is Haimes' phone.

522
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,010
I repeat, everyone converge
on that ringtone.

523
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,683
He's heading north
on track 17!

524
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,921
Hey.

525
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:24,091
When this is all over, we should
take a train trip together.

526
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:26,160
Just for fun.

527
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,463
Go, go, go, go, go!

528
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:34,101
Ray Holt!

529
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,103
Hello, Haimes.

530
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,504
Thought about you
every day I was in jail

531
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,039
just like you said.

532
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,708
I thought about
pointing a gun at you

533
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:42,910
and pulling the trigger.

534
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:45,379
Kinda like this.
<i>Noooo!</i>

535
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:48,649
Terry's back!

536
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,850
Terry's back!

537
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,185
We got him.

538
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,419
Nice work, Jeffords.

539
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:54,788
Nice work, Peralta.

540
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,323
Captain, you're doing it.

541
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,225
You're emoting.

542
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:03,230
<i>I need an
ambulance. Boyle's down.</i>

543
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:06,200
Ah, what happened?
Am I dead?

544
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,068
You saved my life.

545
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,271
Die, pig!

546
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:12,172
<i>Don't!</i>

547
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,741
Ahhh!

548
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:19,113
Oh, my butt!

549
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,015
Oh, my butt.

550
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,920
He's gonna be fine.
You can see him in a minute.

551
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,423
Thank you.

552
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:33,792
Sarge, I'm so glad
that shrink cleared you.

553
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,927
Mm, more or less.

554
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,396
And time's up.

555
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,998
Show me how Terry sees Terry.

556
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,967
Oh, no.

557
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,636
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

558
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,137
Sergeant!
Excuse me, we are...

559
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:47,539
Yeah, can it, quack.

560
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,307
Captain Holt needs your help.
His life is in danger.

561
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,442
<i>Oh, sergeant...</i>

562
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:53,645
I do not think
that you're ready.

563
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:55,013
I'm ready.

564
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,516
Mm-kay, bye!

565
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,785
I owe you one.

566
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,787
Boyle got shot
because of me.

567
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:04,022
This is exactly
the kind of thing

568
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,323
I was hoping to avoid.

569
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:06,858
Captain, this is our job.

570
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,359
Any one of us
would've taken that bullet.

571
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,395
I'm sorry
I've been so difficult.

572
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:11,830
You were right.

573
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,264
We couldn't have caught him
without the team.

574
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,532
Well, well, well.

575
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,802
It appears the student
has become the teacher.

576
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,537
And the teacher hath become...
That's enough.

577
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:20,705
Okay.

578
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:21,973
Thank you.
You're welcome.

579
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:23,675
Team pop and lock.
Here we go!

580
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,376
Whoosh!

581
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:28,246
Come on, still?
We saved your life!

582
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:33,451
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

583
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:34,719
It's happening!
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

584
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,854
Yes! We did it!

585
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:38,823
<i>Excuse me!</i>

586
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:39,991
This is a hospital.

587
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,025
<i>Right. Sorry.</i>

588
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,027
People are dying.

589
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:44,929
You know,
everyone should just go home

590
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,831
and enjoy their Christmas.

591
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,566
You don't need
to stick around here for me.

592
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,635
Shut up,
no one's going anywhere.

593
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,904
What you did was amazing.

594
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:54,272
Yeah, Boyle,
that was some superman stuff.

595
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:56,608
Yeah, you did the nine-nine
proud.

596
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,042
No ifs, ands, or butts.

597
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,345
Sorry, it's just right there.
Literally.

598
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,181
It's just right in front of me.
His butt is right in my face.

599
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,415
I have to tell you guys
something.

600
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,450
Even though I got shot...

601
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:06,718
In the butt.
Sorry.

602
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,253
<i>I'd rather be here,</i>

603
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,654
spending Christmas
with all of you,

604
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:11,723
than on some stupid
singles cruise.

605
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,525
And I mean that,
from the bottom of my...

606
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,926
Butt.
Again, sorry.

607
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,128
Ow!
Shut up, Jake!

608
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,664
Boyle's a hero.

609
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,199
And so is his butt.

610
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,835
I got it!
She smiled!

611
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:25,036
Christmas card complete.

612
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:29,007
He got shot in the butt.

613
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:35,340

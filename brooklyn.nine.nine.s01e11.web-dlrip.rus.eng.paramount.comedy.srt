1
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:06,245
Al right, you'll take this one
on the right,

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:08,677
and I'll take the big one
on the left.

3
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:11,400
NYPD!
Santa, stop hitting Santa.

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:12,648
What's going on here?

5
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:13,961
I've been on this corner
for six years.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,722
Suddenly, this guy shows up.

7
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:16,938
<i>Hey, you don't own
this corner. I got a charity too.</i>

8
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,244
Canine diabetes?
Who cares about fat dogs?

9
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,197
They can't give themselves
shots, they got paws.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,350
All right.
Calm down, calm down.

11
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,143
<i>Boyle, frisk the skinny one.</i>

12
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,488
I've gone 42 years
without a lump of coal.

13
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,928
I'm not gonna start now.

14
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,273
Are you kidding me?

15
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:29,361
All right, fine.
Come here, buddy.

16
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,524
Hey, hey, hey!

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,046
Hit him in his fat
cherry cheeks.

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,775
Ooh!

19
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:39,960
Ugh, that felt wrong.

20
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,952
<i>Knife!</i>

21
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,426
Skinny Santa's got a knife!

22
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:43,834
Ahh!

23
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,955
That's right. Boom!

24
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,299
Just kicked Santa
in the testicles.

25
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,935
Merry Christmas.

26
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:55,576

27
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,316
Looking good.
Happy Hanukkah.

28
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:15,756
You look happy.

29
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:16,845
Let me guess.

30
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:17,966
Your egg sandwich fell
on the floor

31
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,183
and they gave it to you
for free.

32
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,559
No. Can you do that?

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,032
Why doesn't everyone just drop
their sandwiches on the floor?

34
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,369
I was trying to insult you.

35
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:27,251
And instead, you gave me
an amazing life hack.

36
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,741
Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have.
But this is embarrassing.

37
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,438
I didn't get you a present.

38
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,879
The gift is for Captain Holt.

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,288
It's one of six presents
I got him

40
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,753
representing the six lessons
that he's taught me:

41
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:40,634
Determination, wisdom,
posture...

42
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,980
Excuse me, everyone.

43
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,644
As you may know,
this is the holiday season.

44
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,758
<i>Detectives sometimes
feel the urge</i>

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>to buy their captains
holiday presents.</i>

46
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,376
Please refrain
from doing so.

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,913
<i>Under no circumstances</i>

48
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,282
do I want a present.

49
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,523
<i>Peralta, my office.</i>

50
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:56,708
<i>Roger that!</i>

51
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,149
Oh, my God, I have to return
so many items.

52
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,270
I know.

53
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:00,518
Shut up.

54
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:01,864
<i>Thank you for joining us,
Peralta.</i>

55
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,177
This is deputy chief Gerber.

56
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:04,424
Ah, merry Christmas, chief.

57
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,890
And a very merry Christmas
to you, Captain.

58
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,202
Ho, ho, ho!

59
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,644
<i>Captain Holt has received</i>

60
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,181
a number of death threats.

61
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:12,397
Oh.

62
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,126
I really came in here
with the wrong energy.

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,303
Captains receive meaningless
threats all the time.

64
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,096
It's really no big deal.

65
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,312
Of course, totally.

66
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,786
I mean, why would a death threat
be a big deal?

67
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,227
Oh, that's right.
'Cause it threatens death.

68
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,315
It's a hoax.

69
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,596
I didn't wanna alarm the squad.

70
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,197
So, please,
keep this between us.

71
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,918
Awesome.
I'm great at secrets.

72
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,776
Santiago got you
like six presents.

73
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,850
Well, it may be a hoax,
but protocol dictates

74
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,258
that Captain Holt
have a security detail with him

75
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,635
at all times.

76
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,365
He's chosen you
for that detail.

77
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,644
Interesting.

78
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:42,047
And not at all surprising.
I'm his favorite.

79
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,063
Tell me, what would
this job entail?

80
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,049
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt.
Uh-huh.

81
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,226
You'll be entirely in control
of his movements. Amazing.

82
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:50,179
He will not leave your sight.

83
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,004
You have the authority
to make decisions that you feel

84
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,381
are in the best interest
of his safety.

85
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:54,662
Oh, my God.

86
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,294
Basically you'll be
completely in charge.

87
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,576
Oh, well, it sounds
really tough,

88
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,920
but of course I accept,

89
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,225
and I will be willing to put
my life at risk for this man

90
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:02,506
to have to follow
all of my orders.

91
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:03,883
Thank you!
This is the best Christmas ever.

92
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,484
God bless us, everyone!

93
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,557
Hey, my flight
is at 8:00 tonight.

94
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,095
It's domestic.

95
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,495
You think I'll be safe if I get
to the airport five hours early?

96
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,161
Five?
No way!

97
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,826
You gotta do seven.
Seven minimum.

98
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,139
Seven. I knew it.
Yep.

99
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,931
Why are you going
on a singles cruise?

100
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,052
I thought
you were into Rosa.

101
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:21,461
Well, I am.

102
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,702
But I've begun to feel
like there's a slight chance

103
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,335
Rosa may not love me back.

104
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:26,840
Hey, how about we grab
some dinner tonight,

105
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:27,961
just you and me?

106
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,882
That's nice,
and I like you as a person,

107
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,418
but I'm just not interested
in you...

108
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,923
Romantically.

109
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,077
Coolio!

110
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,157
Hey, what say you
we grab a drink?

111
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,534
You're starting
to make this weird.

112
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:39,519
I'm not into you that way,
and I have a boyfriend.

113
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,386
Got you.
Rain check.

114
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,329
A rose... for Rosa.

115
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,514
Listen to me!

116
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,683
The healthy thing for you
to do is move on.

117
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,246
So we both decided
the healthy thing for me to do

118
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,967
is to just move on.

119
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,727
I'm impressed, Charles.
That's very mature.

120
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,944
Thanks.
You know what's funny?

121
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,187
I realized I sometimes...
Oh, no, don't get comfy.

122
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,792
This wasn't an invitation
to keep talking.

123
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,035
Gotcha.
Rain check on the convo.

124
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,732
Yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.

125
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,717
Peralta's busy,
so let's just get started.

126
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,447
<i>Now, the Captain won't allow us
to give him</i>

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,727
all the presents
we bought him.

128
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,905
You are the only one
that did that.

129
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:13,779
But we can make him the greatest
Christmas card of all time.

130
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,468
We're gonna Santa hats
and big sweaters

131
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:17,589
and take a picture of us all
in a lineup.

132
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,773
<i>I'm sorry, Santiago,</i>

133
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,054
but I don't have time
for that.

134
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,688
My psych evaluation is today.

135
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,904
They're gonna decide
if I'm ready

136
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:23,961
to make it back
on the streets.

137
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,114
Why do you care
what they think?

138
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,299
Psychologists are just people

139
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,027
who weren't smart enough
to be psychics.

140
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,269
<i>Don't worry, sergeant.
We'll add you in later.</i>

141
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,399
Sorry, I gotta go too.
My flight is in...

142
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,744
Ah, eight hours.

143
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:36,865
I can make it.

144
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:37,857
I'll buy a sandwich
on the plane.

145
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,329
Boyle!

146
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,251
So if Peralta, Boyle,
and the sergeant are out...

147
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,691
Fine, everyone just go.

148
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:44,293
Yeah.

149
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,814
I could take a pic of myself
dressed up as an elf.

150
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,415
Elfie-selfie.

151
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,336
Not that...

152
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:53,706
But I think there is something
you could help me with.

153
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:57,804
You gonna sit there
all day?

154
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,085
Affirmative, stone eagle.

155
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:01,775
That's the Secret Service
codename I gave you.

156
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,279
Just sitting here
doing my job,

157
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,521
watching, protecting,
bossing you around.

158
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,737
Now, for your safety,

159
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:07,858
if you could open up
your Internet browser

160
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,107
and search the words
"pigs" and "jet skis,"

161
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,419
and that's an order.

162
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,206
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going, Cold Mountain?

163
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,293
I changed your codename.

164
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,735
To use the restroom.

165
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,464
I'm only asking this
for your safety.

166
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,800
Is it a number one
or a number two?

167
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,138
Your silence indicates
number two.

168
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,059
Let me do some recon.

169
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,958
It's all clear, sir.

170
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,616
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go,

171
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:36,034
go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

172
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,347
Cold Mountain
is on the move.

173
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:40,165
I repeat, Cold Mountain
is rolling to the can.

174
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:43,399
Sergeant Jeffords,
thank you for coming in today.

175
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,952
We are here to assess
your readiness for active duty,

176
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:50,410
and if all goes
I will stamp this release form,

177
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,851
you can go
back in the field.

178
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,645
Well, I think I'm ready.

179
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,687
I am no longer fixating
on my fears, ha.

180
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,631
Good. But for today,
let's... fixate on those fears.

181
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,154
Okay.
Um...

182
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,531
That sounds fun.

183
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,348
<i>Let's begin by talking
about your baby girls</i>

184
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,526
and your wife,

185
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,607
and what would happen to them
if you died...

186
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,496
In the line of duty.

187
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,698
I popped your pillow.

188
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,577
<i>Captain...</i>

189
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,529
Where do you think
you're going?

190
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:32,259
I'm going home
to work in peace.

191
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,852
That's a negative, ice veins.
Changed your codename again.

192
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,446
Do you know why I chose you
to be my security escort?

193
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,078
Because I'm a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes?

194
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,288
No, I chose you
because the threat is not real.

195
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,793
Mm-hmm.

196
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:44,425
And I thought you'd have
no problem breaking the rules

197
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,898
and letting me
get my work done.

198
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,307
Now... let me go.

199
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,748
Well, you thought wrong.

200
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,444
You can't go home.
It's protocol.

201
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,110
But if you really wanna
get outta here,

202
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:53,838
you can come to my mom's.

203
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,343
She lives nearby.

204
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:56,464
Or I can lock you up
in the holding cell

205
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,585
with an armed escort.

206
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,770
Totally your call.

207
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:01,236
Fine. We will go
to your mother's house.

208
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,252
I guess I am curious
to see where...

209
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:05,014
This all started.

210
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,999
Shotgun.

211
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,040
So... this is my mom's place.

212
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:14,491
You can just throw your jacket
in the closet.

213
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,675
That's a bathroom.

214
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,885
Water closet.
My mom's British.

215
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,582
Hmm.

216
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,927
Why are there
no photographs of you?

217
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,328
No holiday decorations.

218
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,314
Nothing but...

219
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,843
Motel art.

220
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,788
This isn't
your mom's apartment.

221
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,606
It's a safe house, son!
You've been protected.

222
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:35,463
Don't say "son."

223
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:37,000
Get outta my way.

224
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,280
Look, you wouldn't stay
at your desk

225
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:39,562
and you evaded
your protection detail.

226
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,323
I'm sorry, but I've gotta
order you to stay.

227
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:42,763
I love giving you orders.

228
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,044
The only way you're gonna
keep me here

229
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,389
is if you physically stop me.

230
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,445
Can you do that, Peralta?

231
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:50,384
I didn't think so.

232
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,433
Jordan.
Ahh!

233
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,713
<i>Oh, no.</i>

234
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,987
We're handcuffed together
and we've lost the key.

235
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,388
Falconer one to HQ,
stone eagle is in the cage.

236
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,598
I repeat,
stone eagle is in the cage.

237
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:09,217
I told you the death threat
was not serious.

238
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,395
So what on earth
are you doing?

239
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,347
Look, I know you think
that I'm just goofing around,

240
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,525
but I got a direct order
from your boss

241
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:16,903
to protect you.

242
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,407
So from this point forward,
we're on lockdown.

243
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,264
Fine. But before we go
into lockdown...

244
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:21,544
Too late.
You're on it.

245
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:22,697
I'd like to text my husband

246
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:23,882
and tell him I'll be
coming home late tonight.

247
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,258
<i>All right,
but for security reasons,</i>

248
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,508
I get to craft the message.

249
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,333
Let's start
with a pleasant greeting.

250
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,773
How about...
"Hello, honey."

251
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,342
You will not craft
the message.

252
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,943
Okay, Roger that.
"Honey's" wrong.

253
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,480
How about "hello, husband"?

254
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:35,729
How about "hello, sir"?

255
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,097
You call each other "sir"?
Give me my phone.

256
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:40,628
Fine.

257
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,741
I'll give you some privacy.

258
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:46,967
Maybe put Hitchcock's head
on top like an angel.

259
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,024
Mm.

260
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,009
<i>Like that?</i>

261
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,738
No, put it behind the tree.

262
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,178
<i>Thanks for helping
me make this card.</i>

263
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,427
You're so good
at this stuff.

264
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,573
I know.
I'm good at everything.

265
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,750
All right, so here's
all the pictures of Rosa

266
00:08:58,751 --> 00:08:59,903
that we have.

267
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,471
<i>Which one should we use?</i>

268
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:04,257
She never smiles.
Is her mouth broken?

269
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,178
Well, what about if we...

270
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,774
<i>Flip those lips?</i>

271
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,148
Oh, God.
Oof!

272
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,590
<i>That's horrifying.</i>

273
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:12,775
We have to get a picture
of Rosa smiling.

274
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,823
<i>Holt's card
has to be perfect.</i>

275
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,584
Guys... I got this.

276
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,377
<i>I can make Rosa smile.</i>

277
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,203
Just keep your cameras ready.

278
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,660
Making coffee?

279
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:24,944
<i>Can you make another cup</i>

280
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,727
for senor tickle
and his nueve amigos?

281
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,975
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

282
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:32,308
What the hell, Hitchcock?
Ow, ahh! Ow, ow, ow!

283
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,842
I think you sprained
senor tickle.

284
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,956
Next time, I break it off.

285
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,837
<i>Ow!</i>

286
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,558
All right.

287
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,160
My safe house,
my rules.

288
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,746
This is a no tie zone.

289
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,595
A hungry safe house
is an unsafe safe house.

290
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,918
A fun safe house
is a safe safe house.

291
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,583
My serve.

292
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,727
Ah.

293
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:00,609
I thought you said
you've never played this.

294
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,569
It's very intuitive.

295
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,267
Let's have another sandwich.

296
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,932
A <i>safe house-</i> watching
safe house

297
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:07,077
is a safe safe house house.

298
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:08,358
I've already seen the film.

299
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,606
I enjoyed it.

300
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,952
Wow, I would not
have guessed that.

301
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,552
You see, those are the kind
of things that you learn

302
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:13,897
when you're handcuffed
together.

303
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,403
And that is the true meaning
of Christmas.

304
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,124
Who knows we're here?

305
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:20,973
Get behind me.

306
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,350
No, no!
Going over!

307
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,591
Standard protocol suggests
that you put me in another room

308
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:26,096
before you open the door.

309
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,217
But since you've cuffed us
together...

310
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:28,306
I order you to be quiet.

311
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,650
Come on.

312
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,966
Freeze, sicko!
Ah!

313
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,662
Jake, it's me,
Charles from work.

314
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:41,754
Okay, let's switch gears,
do a little word association.

315
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,419
<i>What do you think of</i>

316
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:44,731
when I say the word "bottle"?

317
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:49,149
Liquor store, holdup,
gun, die.

318
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,302
How about "grass"?

319
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,376
Marijuana, drugs.

320
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:55,361
Gun, die.

321
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:56,385
Cat.

322
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:57,923
Kitten.

323
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:58,980
Cute.

324
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,509
<i>Calm.
False sense of security.</i>

325
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,238
Gun, die.

326
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,574
<i>What are you doing?</i>

327
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,208
You gonna stamp my form?

328
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:12,011
No. I just didn't want the ink
to dry out.

329
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:14,796
Boyle, what are you
doing here?

330
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,045
I thought you had
to catch a flight.

331
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,966
I do.
My flight is in six hours.

332
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,311
But the Captain
texted me to come,

333
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,528
so I'm here.
What?

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,872
You texted Boyle
when you told me

335
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,121
you were texting
your husband?

336
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,170
As the person who's completely
in charge here,

337
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,284
I am <i>very</i> disappointed
in you.

338
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:30,005
I'm changing your codename
to "bad boy."

339
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,350
Oh, I can't imagine
what it's like

340
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:33,207
to be disappointed at
someone under your command.

341
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,769
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Tushy.

342
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,689
It's touche.

343
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:39,131
Well, I'm in charge,
and I say it's tushy.

344
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,090
Boyle?

345
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,339
I've heard it both ways.

346
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,621
Please don't involve me
in this.

347
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:43,774
I'm just here
to uncuff the Captain

348
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,021
and take him
to his old precinct.

349
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,174
What?

350
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,712
Old precinct?
Wait a minute.

351
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,312
You weren't going home
at all.

352
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,977
You were going
to investigate the threat

353
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,514
because it's not a hoax,
it's real!

354
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,500
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!

355
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:55,684
You have a tell.

356
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,348
When you lie,
the corner of your mouth moves,

357
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,501
and it just moved.

358
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,038
Wrong, it's not real.

359
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,095
You're lying!

360
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:02,376
Fine.

361
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:03,656
I believe the threat is real,

362
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,193
though I'm not sure
who's behind it.

363
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,794
But this is my problem,

364
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,139
and I'm gonna solve it
on my own.

365
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,483
Boyle, uncuff me.
Don't do it, Charles.

366
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:10,925
I'll take you on that trip
to the botanical gardens

367
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,557
we've always talked about.

368
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,838
Uncuff me,
and that's a direct order.

369
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,280
Don't do it, best friend.
Botanical gardens.

370
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:17,616
Ah! This is just like Christmas
at my parents' house.

371
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,218
Why do they have
separate dining rooms?

372
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:22,003
I...

373
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:24,628
No!

374
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,294
<i>That was not
one of the options!</i>

375
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,990
I couldn't choose,
I love you both so much.

376
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,032
Who wants to watch <i>safe house?</i>

377
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,371
So, including letters, e-mails,
and texts from a blocked phone,

378
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,972
we have received
ten threats.

379
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,413
How many people
have you put away

380
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:41,629
that might want you dead?

381
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:42,910
I've arrested
over 600 people.

382
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,062
Brag.

383
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,312
Boyle, will you please
read the transcripts

384
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,592
<i>of the threats
he's received?</i>

385
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:47,745
Yup.

386
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:49,666
"Die, die, die."
"Die, Holt, die."

387
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,299
Okay, a little obvious.

388
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,771
"You will drown
in your own blood."

389
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,116
<i>Better.</i>

390
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,430
Although I would've gone
with the whole,

391
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:56,838
"I'm gonna staple my face
onto your face" thing.

392
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,240
Human skin mask.
Classic.

393
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,737
The next one is "I'm gonna
send you off the deep end."

394
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,689
"Drowning" and "deep end."

395
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,803
Almost sounds like he's talking
about a swimming pool.

396
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,437
It's Haimes.

397
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,684
Aha!
Who's Haimes?

398
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:11,343
Colin Haimes,
the freestyle killer.

399
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:15,057
He took out an entire 4x100
meter relay swim team in 1982.

400
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:18,707
Marco.

401
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:23,605
Now you say "polo," punk.

402
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,078
The freestyle killer.

403
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:26,712
Man! How come
all the killers you've caught

404
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,120
had such cool names?

405
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,617
The best name I ever brought in
was "narrow shoes" Sam,

406
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,218
because... his shoes were
narrow and his name was Sam.

407
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,011
I get it.
Yeah, you get it.

408
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,861
Well, Captain, it looks like
you needed our help after all.

409
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:38,462
Together, we figured out
it was Haimes,

410
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,030
and together,
we're gonna take him down.

411
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,016
Because together,
we can do anything.

412
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,649
Here we go!

413
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,499
I'm finding Haimes
<i>alone.</i>

414
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,957
Coming back at you, Jake!

415
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,216
Oh, my God, Rosa!

416
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:55,528
I accidentally
opened your mail,

417
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:56,552
but look what it says.

418
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,402
"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."

419
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:00,683
Rosa, guess what.

420
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,092
I accidentally
opened your mail,

421
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:03,244
and here's what it says.

422
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,781
<i>"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."</i>

423
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,478
No, I'm reading the letter,
and you're taking the picture.

424
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,438
What?

425
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,784
Ha!

426
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,064
You were trying to get me
to smile for your dumb picture,

427
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,921
but you messed up.

428
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:13,714
Ah! She smiled.
She's smiling!

429
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:15,539
And no one has a camera.

430
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:17,012
Got it, Amy.

431
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,357
Got a picture
of you frowning.

432
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,542
That's what you wanted,
right?

433
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:23,544
Peralta,
for the last time

434
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:24,632
we don't have to go back
to the precinct.

435
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,754
I don't need
everyone's help.

436
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,546
Look, Captain,
you're stubborn.

437
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:28,923
And that's
an adorable quality.

438
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:31,004
You wanna know what's not
an adorable quality?

439
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,092
Being dead.
Acne.

440
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,246
Yep, being dead.

441
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,270
I mean, I give up.

442
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:35,390
What's going on with you?

443
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,576
Why are you being
so weird about this?

444
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:37,793
I don't need your help.

445
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,866
I don't wanna involve you,
or Boyle, or anyone.

446
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,404
Because I brought
this situation on myself.

447
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:45,252
No one should get hurt
because of a dumb mistake I made

448
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:46,917
as a brash, young Detective.

449
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,262
Hey, Haimes.

450
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,575
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life

451
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,201
in a little cement room,
doing nothing.

452
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:55,018
And while you're in there,
I'm gonna go for a swim.

453
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,828
And after that swim,
I might take another swim.

454
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,429
And you'll just be
sitting there

455
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:03,407
on your metal toilet,

456
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:07,184
thinking of me
swim, swim, swimming

457
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,458
all day long.

458
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,770
When I get out of lockup,

459
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,948
I'm gonna hunt you down
and kill you.

460
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:14,805
Yeah.

461
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,022
Right.

462
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,463
Wow.

463
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:18,775
I think I really would've gotten
along with young Ray Holt.

464
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:19,800
Yes, that's why I decided

465
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,434
to change everything
about my life.

466
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,066
Well, frankly, sir,
you're still acting

467
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,475
like that brash,
dumb Detective.

468
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,621
If you had truly changed,
you'd be saying

469
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,510
a bunch of boring,
responsible stuff, like...

470
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,823
"Don't be stupid.

471
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:31,646
"Use the Detective squad.
You're part of a team.

472
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,864
I smell like sandalwood."

473
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,305
That's what it is!

474
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:36,449
Yet another terrible impression,
Peralta.

475
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,795
But I think you're right.

476
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,459
Wait, what?

477
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,469
Sir, I'm sure
you had your reasons

478
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,070
for going to Peralta,
but...

479
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:46,696
This is exactly the type of job
I would love to have.

480
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,873
Okay, the next time someone
threatens to kill me,

481
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,122
I'll come straight to you.

482
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,722
Thank you, sir.

483
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,708
I can't wait.

484
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,877
I... didn't mean...

485
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:59,054
Let's catch this bastard.

486
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:02,385
All right, let's go!
Updates. Santiago.

487
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,242
Looking into Haimes' associates.
Nothing yet.

488
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,099
Boyle?

489
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,572
Uh, some intel coming in
from ossining.

490
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,108
Haimes was released
two weeks ago.

491
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:12,150
Good. Hitchcock and Scully,
update on your secret project?

492
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,592
Hazelnut coffee'll be up
in five minutes.

493
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,032
Sumatran's ready to go.

494
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,153
Keep me updated.

495
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:17,274
Warrant for the phone trace
came through.

496
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,521
We got Haimes' number...

497
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:20,411
And the last coordinates
from its GPS.

498
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,981
The rail yards.

499
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,022
All right, we got him.
Everyone suit up!

500
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,814
I know there's no point
in telling you not to come,

501
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:28,256
but while we're out there,
you're sticking with me.

502
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,505
Oh. Goodie.

503
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,457
Man, you really know
how to take the fun

504
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,578
out of saving your life.

505
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,243
You heard him, Hitchcock.

506
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,780
Get that Sumatran
in the thermos.

507
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,702
I'm on it.

508
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,995
If things go south,
I just want you to know

509
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,267
it's been an honor
being able to boss you around.

510
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,805
Anything else?

511
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,942
Yes. What cute little nickname
do you call your husband?

512
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,607
Kevin.

513
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,272
Adorable.

514
00:16:57,874 --> 00:16:59,185
Sorry you
missed your flight.

515
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,579
I have a backup flight
in four hours.

516
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,409
Gotta flush him out.

517
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,856
We got his number now.
Call his phone.

518
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:11,448
Smart.

519
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,835
It's ringing.

520
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,236
This is exciting.

521
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:23,776
That is Haimes' phone.

522
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,465
I repeat, everyone converge
on that ringtone.

523
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,909
He's heading north
on track 17!

524
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,935
Hey.

525
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:39,977
When this is all over, we should
take a train trip together.

526
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,962
Just for fun.

527
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,132
Go, go, go, go, go!

528
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:49,583
Ray Holt!

529
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,503
Hello, Haimes.

530
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,848
Thought about you
every day I was in jail

531
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,321
just like you said.

532
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:55,923
I thought about
pointing a gun at you

533
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,035
and pulling the trigger.

534
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,405
Kinda like this.
<i>Noooo!</i>

535
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:03,543
Terry's back!

536
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:04,695
Terry's back!

537
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:05,976
We got him.

538
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:07,160
Nice work, Jeffords.

539
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,434
Nice work, Peralta.

540
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:10,906
Captain, you're doing it.

541
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,732
You're emoting.

542
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,535
<i>I need an
ambulance. Boyle's down.</i>

543
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,385
Ah, what happened?
Am I dead?

544
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,177
You saved my life.

545
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,291
Die, pig!

546
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,115
<i>Don't!</i>

547
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,621
Ahhh!

548
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:32,776
Oh, my butt!

549
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,601
Oh, my butt.

550
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,186
He's gonna be fine.
You can see him in a minute.

551
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,589
Thank you.

552
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,861
Sarge, I'm so glad
that shrink cleared you.

553
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:48,911
Mm, more or less.

554
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:51,279
And time's up.

555
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,817
Show me how Terry sees Terry.

556
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,666
Oh, no.

557
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,268
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

558
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,708
Sergeant!
Excuse me, we are...

559
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,053
Yeah, can it, quack.

560
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,749
Captain Holt needs your help.
His life is in danger.

561
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,839
<i>Oh, sergeant...</i>

562
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:05,912
I do not think
that you're ready.

563
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,225
I'm ready.

564
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,586
Mm-kay, bye!

565
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,764
I owe you one.

566
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,685
Boyle got shot
because of me.

567
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:15,870
This is exactly
the kind of thing

568
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,119
I was hoping to avoid.

569
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,591
Captain, this is our job.

570
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,032
Any one of us
would've taken that bullet.

571
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,985
I'm sorry
I've been so difficult.

572
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,363
You were right.

573
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,739
We couldn't have caught him
without the team.

574
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:25,955
Well, well, well.

575
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,094
It appears the student
has become the teacher.

576
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,758
And the teacher hath become...
That's enough.

577
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,879
Okay.

578
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,096
Thank you.
You're welcome.

579
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,729
Team pop and lock.
Here we go!

580
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,361
Whoosh!

581
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:39,115
Come on, still?
We saved your life!

582
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,110
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

583
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,326
It's happening!
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

584
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,416
Yes! We did it!

585
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,264
<i>Excuse me!</i>

586
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,385
This is a hospital.

587
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,378
<i>Right. Sorry.</i>

588
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:53,299
People are dying.

589
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,124
You know,
everyone should just go home

590
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,950
and enjoy their Christmas.

591
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,614
You don't need
to stick around here for me.

592
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,600
Shut up,
no one's going anywhere.

593
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,777
What you did was amazing.

594
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,090
Yeah, Boyle,
that was some superman stuff.

595
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,331
Yeah, you did the nine-nine
proud.

596
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,707
No ifs, ands, or butts.

597
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,917
Sorry, it's just right there.
Literally.

598
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,639
It's just right in front of me.
His butt is right in my face.

599
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,822
I have to tell you guys
something.

600
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:14,816
Even though I got shot...

601
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,033
In the butt.
Sorry.

602
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,505
<i>I'd rather be here,</i>

603
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:18,850
spending Christmas
with all of you,

604
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,836
than on some stupid
singles cruise.

605
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,565
And I mean that,
from the bottom of my...

606
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:23,909
Butt.
Again, sorry.

607
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,022
Ow!
Shut up, Jake!

608
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,456
Boyle's a hero.

609
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,928
And so is his butt.

610
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,458
I got it!
She smiled!

611
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,610
Christmas card complete.

612
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,421
He got shot in the butt.

613
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:43,498

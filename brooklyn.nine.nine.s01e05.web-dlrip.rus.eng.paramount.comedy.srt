1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:04,025
Hey, you guys see the dude
I brought in today...

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,325
The drug dealer? 81 years old.

3
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:08,860
I think it's the oldest collar
of my entire career.

4
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:11,988
I once arrested a 96-year-old
for flashing.

5
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,872
I was terrified he'd die
in my backseat...

6
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:15,211
Or flash me.

7
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:18,412
My oldest collar was 78,
but the PCP

8
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:19,693
made her fight like she was 20.

9
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:21,166
What about two
50-year-old twins?

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,447
Does that count
as a 100-year-old?

11
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:23,408
- No good.
- No.

12
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,205
You talking oldest bags? 68.

13
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,176
That's not that old.
Yeah, but I was only 20.

14
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:29,790
20? Were you even a cop then?

15
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,771
No, man, it was before
I got into the academy.

16
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:37,099
Charles isn't talking
about his oldest arrest.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,090
Ew!

18
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:39,084
No... yes, I am.

19
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:40,814
Yeah, oldest arrest...
68, like I said.

20
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,733
God, you had sex
with a 68-year-old

21
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,047
when you were in your 20s?

22
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,296
You know how it is.

23
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,250
When you have a chance
to bed an older woman, you...

24
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,129
No, that is not an older woman.
That's an old woman!

25
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,474
That's someone's grandma!

26
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,980
She was, actually.
That's how I met her.

27
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,870
Went to college
with her grandson Marvin.

28
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,697
Don't... don't knock it
till you try it.

29
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,842
She had a replacement hip
with some serious torque.

30
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:01,117
It was like having sex
with a transformer.

31
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:03,229
No. That is no one's fantasy.

32
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:24,314
Peralta...

33
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,074
Where are we
on the Lincoln place murder?

34
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:28,635
Well, like I told Captain Holt
earlier this week,

35
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:30,875
we are at the one-yard line.
It's a football reference.

36
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,403
Yes, Jake.
I played linebacker at Syracuse.

37
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:36,092
Really? In High School,
I played center field

38
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,563
in the musical damn Yankees.

39
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,003
Yeah, you don't want
to brag about that.

40
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,957
Peralta, you want
to loop everyone in?

41
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:43,166
- Ehh...
- That was not a request.

42
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,120
Fine.

43
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,619
Get ready for some stuff
on a screen.

44
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,891
Meet Fred Gorman...

45
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,092
Prominent citizen,
lawyer, corpse.

46
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,332
Now meet his wife, Ann Hoert.

47
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,060
She did not take his last name,

48
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,014
but I believe she did
take his life.

49
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,583
- Nice.
- Thank you, Charles.

50
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:03,303
Now, Hoert had means,
motives, and opportunity.

51
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:04,937
I just need to find
the murder weapon.

52
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,985
For some reason, the D.A. won't
move forward with the arrest

53
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,297
until we find the knife
she used.

54
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,345
Is that reason that they want
to win the case?

55
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:11,337
Yes.

56
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,907
Well, find it.

57
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:14,187
The family's close
to the mayor,

58
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:15,821
and I'm catching heat
from the higher-ups.

59
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:17,037
I'm gonna ask you again.

60
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:19,181
Do you need any resources
or personnel?

61
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:20,781
No, sir, I've got it.

62
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,125
Okay.

63
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:23,791
Dismissed!

64
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,103
Sergeant Jeffords, my office.

65
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,287
Uh-oh.

66
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:27,823
He probably wants
to talk to you

67
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:29,743
about how your shirts aren't
tight enough probably.

68
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,777
Okay, how can we help?
What do you need?

69
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,993
I need nothing.

70
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:37,586
I'm about to solve this case,
meet the mayor,

71
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:39,186
and sell my life rights
to Channing Tatum

72
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,532
so he can play
my less attractive brother

73
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:41,715
in the ensuing film.

74
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:44,276
- Come on, Peralta,
- Holt said to use the whole team.

75
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:45,461
We all want this solved.

76
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:48,917
I appreciate the offer,
but I work best alone...

77
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,646
Except when it comes to sex.

78
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,920
Actually,
sometimes including sex.

79
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,359
Will you just let us help?

80
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:55,545
Okay, fine.

81
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,135
I will let one
of you help me... Charles.

82
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,609
Yeah!

83
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,336
And I am choosing Charles
because he's the least likely

84
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:02,649
to steal my thunder.

85
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,539
I would never steal
his thunder.

86
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,260
I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.

87
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,970
Terry, I'd like you
to accompany me to a gun range.

88
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,052
You mean drive you there
and wait outside...

89
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,556
Far away from the guns.

90
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,925
I spent eight years
in the public affairs office,

91
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,493
so my tactical skills
are a little rusty.

92
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:19,870
I need some pointers.

93
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,590
Sir, I haven't fired a weapon
since the incident.

94
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,310
The mannequin incident...
I'm familiar.

95
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,721
Actually, there was an incident
after that.

96
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:35,810
Another incident?

97
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,691
You got to cool it, man.

98
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,292
I'm gonna get some candy.

99
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,787
Sir, I may not be the man
for the job.

100
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,836
You used to be the precinct's
champion marksman.

101
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,436
I only want to take pointers
from the best.

102
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,262
So I'll keep it low-key.

103
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:54,149
We'll go after work
to a private range.

104
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,686
No cops, no pressure.

105
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:57,895
Blam! Blam, blam!

106
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,400
Gun range.

107
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,769
I told Gina she could join us.
I want to get certified.

108
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,720
There has been a ton of crime
in my neighborhood,

109
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,281
and the cops in my precinct
are very bad.

110
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,818
You live in our precinct.

111
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,442
Yeah, I know.

112
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,491
I know we've
gone over this before,

113
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,187
but I have to ask you again.

114
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,236
Is there anywhere
you can think of in that hallway

115
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:17,611
where a knife could be hidden?

116
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,717
Well, since I've already
told you, like, three times, no,

117
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,284
why don't I just record it?

118
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,725
Then I don't have
to say it again.

119
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:27,053
The hallway,
like all other hallways,

120
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,773
does not have
a secret knife-hiding place.

121
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:31,599
All right,
you want to hear it again?

122
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
Idea for a novel...

123
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,439
A mild-mannered doorman
gets bitten on the penis

124
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,007
by a radioactive spider

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,471
and becomes the world's
greatest lover.

126
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,944
No, don't stop it.
I want to hear what happens.

127
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,193
This is terrific.

128
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,729
He saves the first lady,
if you must know.

129
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,032
Sounds compelling.

130
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:49,969
Oh, boy.

131
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,538
Well, hello.

132
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,033
I heard you guys
were making the rounds again.

133
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,571
All right.

134
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,588
- This one's all you, tiger.
- Come on!

135
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,950
Police!

136
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,543
Hey, ma'am.

137
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,079
Thank God! Here, hold this.

138
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,896
The lasagna's burning. Okay.

139
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,072
Get the dog, but don't
let it touch the baby!

140
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,556
Oh. Okay. Peralta.

141
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,180
Yo, I looked at the photos
of your victim on your desk.

142
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:18,877
Is that Rosa?
Tell her I said hi.

143
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,157
The puncture wounds are similar

144
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,566
to a case I had a while back.

145
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:22,912
They aren't from a knife.

146
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,095
I think it's something spiral,
like a corkscrew.

147
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,087
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

148
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,752
Don't shush me.
I'm helping you.

149
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,065
No, no, I'm holding a baby.

150
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,696
That was actually very helpful,
thank you.

151
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,803
Uh-oh.
You better get back here. Now.

152
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,892
Oh! Hello, Peralta.

153
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,772
No, no, no!

154
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,273
I don't know why
you're so upset, man.

155
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,673
I'm the one who had to come
to this backwater stink hole.

156
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:50,775
What's up, little man?

157
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:52,875
What's up? Feeling sexy? Huh?

158
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,156
Yeah, I feel sexy.

159
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,469
Yeah, you look sexy, man.
You know I do.

160
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,422
Watch out for that door.

161
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,559
Yo, how much you bench,
seriously?

162
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,641
Captain, please, please,
pretty please

163
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,183
do not let him take over
my case.

164
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,449
Major crimes is stepping in.
Nothing I can do.

165
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,538
You're off the case.

166
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:08,851
I can't believe
you're just rolling over

167
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,772
and giving my murder away
to the vulture.

168
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,244
We call him the vulture
because he swoops in

169
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,750
and solves cases
that are almost solved

170
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,190
and takes the credit
for himself.

171
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,668
Yes, Boyle, I put that together
from context.

172
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:20,231
First of all,
major crimes has jurisdiction

173
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,433
over any and all cases
they want to take.

174
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,843
But more importantly,

175
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:24,924
you're the one who insisted
on working alone.

176
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,005
I told you for weeks
to use the squad,

177
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,126
and you refused.

178
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,533
I used them.

179
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,519
I mean, Rosa's the one
who figured out the corkscrew.

180
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,888
And Charles caught a dog.

181
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,290
Oh, congratulations,
Detective Boyle.

182
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,698
You should've
involved him sooner.

183
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,492
Turn over your files
to Detective Pembroke.

184
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,932
Sir, call him the vulture.

185
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,245
Giving him a name
makes him human.

186
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,094
Turn over the files.

187
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,149
Fine.

188
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,335
But in protest,

189
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm walking over there
extremely slowly.

190
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,708
Thank you.

191
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,615
God! This is so boring!

192
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,249
For both of us.

193
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,784
You know,
before I solve this case,

194
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,378
I'd like to thank you for doing
all the super-easy work,

195
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,426
you know, the real
Nancy drew-level stuff.

196
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,736
Oh, yeah? Did Nancy drew solve
a lot of murders?

197
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,653
Yeah, she did... Murder on ice,

198
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:14,805
recipe for murder.

199
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,310
Nancy was
a wonderful Detective.

200
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,430
I wanted to be her
when I grew up.

201
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,639
Thanks, Charles.
That's helpful.

202
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,841
Hey! Should we take odds on
how fast I'll solve this case?

203
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,178
- Nope.
- I mean, what was it with Diaz's last

204
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,427
"impossible" extortion case?

205
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:28,476
What was it, six hours?

206
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,397
That's because
it was 98% solved.

207
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:32,990
The last 2%
is the hardest to get.

208
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,752
That's why they leave it
in the milk.

209
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,000
What?

210
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,120
Oh! Wow!

211
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:38,849
Looking good, Santiago.

212
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,418
You foxy ma.

213
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,828
Go rot in hell.

214
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,332
This is your fault.

215
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,726
Thanks, champ. Good effort.

216
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,326
I got it from here.

217
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,926
And, hey,
you feel free to call me

218
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,528
anytime you need me
to come down here

219
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,757
and help powder
that big white ass of yours.

220
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,474
Well, that's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

221
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,918
I hate the vulture so much!

222
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,055
Me too. But he's kind of hot.

223
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,401
What?

224
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,874
You can hate people
and still think they're hot.

225
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,345
Case in point, Manuel Noriega.

226
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:11,811
You know what?
I'm with you on this.

227
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:12,929
Tonya Harding.

228
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,108
- Yeah, she's thick.
- Right?

229
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:16,997
- Always classy, Jake.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,950
Sorry you got vultured.

231
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,102
Happens to the best of us.

232
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,351
On my count.

233
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,133
One, two...

234
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:25,161
Three! I got it from here!

235
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,346
Yeah!

236
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,138
Get up! Get up! Turn around!

237
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:30,668
You have the right
to remain silent.

238
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:31,917
Anything you say...

239
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,031
Can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

240
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,182
Thanks, guys,
I got it from here.

241
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,624
Let's go. Beat it!

242
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,608
Skim white chocolate macchiato
for Charles.

243
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,985
I got it from here.

244
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,098
I used a gift card for that!

245
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,723
God, I just... I want to get
back at him so bad!

246
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,933
I wish I could throw
his cell phone in the toilet

247
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,333
or slash his tires...
I don't know.

248
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,807
Or slash his gorgeous throat.

249
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,887
I cannot figure you out.

250
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,361
Okay, I'm buying
everyone drinks

251
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,409
as long as we're here
thinking of a revenge plan.

252
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,394
Best idea gets 50 bucks.

253
00:08:58,395 --> 00:08:59,642
Throw 'em on out.

254
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,018
What if you called him
from a hospital

255
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,812
and said his whole family
is dead?

256
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,412
Like, they died of cancer.

257
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,398
Charles, that is so dark.

258
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,678
I'm putting it down.

259
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,952
So my stance feels good,

260
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:12,288
- but I'm still not hitting center.
- All right.

261
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,273
Back your left foot up a hair.

262
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:15,553
Like this?

263
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,578
Mm, mm, mm!

264
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,243
No! Gina! We've been over this.

265
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,812
Well, show me!

266
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:23,718
Like, wrap your thick,
muscular arms around me and...

267
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,774
All right, look,

268
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,336
hands here, stand up straight,
chin forward.

269
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:28,584
Hold on, my nose itches.

270
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,961
Gina!

271
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:32,298
When I lock my shooting arm,
the other hand feels unstable.

272
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:33,932
Now, what stance
am I supposed to be doing...

273
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,244
Weaver or isosceles?

274
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:36,908
You guys did stances?
Like, I'll be like...

275
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,998
Yeah, everybody
does stances, Gina.

276
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,917
Listen, uh...
Hey, all right, all right!

277
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:42,383
Look, hey, both you,
just watch.

278
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,545
That's eight! He did it!

279
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,619
That was only seven.

280
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,020
Why are you counting my shots?

281
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,749
Are you trying
to have me recertified?

282
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,318
Yes.

283
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,885
If you make eight of ten shots,

284
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:58,807
I can sign off on
you carrying a gun again.

285
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,280
Gina's here
as an official witness,

286
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,432
and I thought
it'd be easier for you

287
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,522
in a no-pressure environment.

288
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,602
I can't believe you tricked me!

289
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,651
You're too good a cop
to be shackled to a desk.

290
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:10,365
You only have one hit
until you get recertified.

291
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:13,439
So deep breath, huh?

292
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,416
Take the final shot.

293
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,394
Don't overthink it.

294
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:22,020
Just relax and breathe.

295
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,356
Bring air into your lungs...

296
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,438
Like you've done
your whole life.

297
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,831
Oh, my God.

298
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:32,455
Guys! How do you breathe?

299
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,025
I forgot how to breathe!

300
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,354
Is it two in, one out?

301
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,692
What if we wrap his motorcycle
in plastic wrap

302
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,677
and melt it with a hair dryer?

303
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:44,238
Little trick I learned
in gift basket making class.

304
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,319
All right.
Here's what we're up to.

305
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,425
Steal his kidney,
burn down his house,

306
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,569
replace his aloe tissues
with regular tissues.

307
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,850
Thank you, Charles.
You're welcome.

308
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,803
Leave a dead cat
in his cedar closet.

309
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,365
He would have
to own a cedar closet.

310
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:59,286
He seems like he would.

311
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,528
Sneak into his apartment and
burn popcorn in the microwave.

312
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,800
Thank you, Charles.

313
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,530
Uh, Scully asked
for mashed potatoes,

314
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,650
so I wrote that down.

315
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,827
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think, by default,

316
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:11,004
Charles' motorcycle idea
is the winner.

317
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,310
Yeah! Winning by default.

318
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:14,558
Let's get into it.

319
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,158
Anybody know
where the vulture lives?

320
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,431
On third, right near here.
How do you know that?

321
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,223
Chug 'em, boys. We're rolling!

322
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:22,497
Yes!

323
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,649
Take that, vulture!

324
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,122
- Yeah.
- Nice.

325
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,723
All right,
give me your hair dryer.

326
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:28,291
What?
What are you talking about?

327
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,701
Don't you carry one
in your purse?

328
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:32,133
Have you ever met
a human woman?

329
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:34,119
There's a drugstore
four blocks away... I'm on it.

330
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,527
Oh, no.

331
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:37,641
Scully traveling four blocks?

332
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,593
That could take weeks.

333
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:41,931
Hoo!

334
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,180
Take the shot, sergeant.

335
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:44,556
I just need a second.

336
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,701
You've had 18 minutes
of seconds.

337
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,759
Gina's authentic
stolen police badges.

338
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,074
How can I help?

339
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,834
- Hey, it's Peralta.
- Oh, hey, Jake.

340
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:56,754
Hey, do you carry
a hair dryer in your purse?

341
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,516
Of course. I'm not an animal.

342
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,564
Great.

343
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,909
I need you to bring it
to the vulture's apartment.

344
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,222
There's someone named
"the vulture"?

345
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,240
Tell Rosa. She'd be into that.

346
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,551
Come on!

347
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,696
Peralta, why are you asking Gina
about Detective Pembroke?

348
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,362
Oh, Captain, hello.

349
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,883
Uh, we are preparing him
a gift basket of sorts.

350
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,580
Look,
I understand that you're upset.

351
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,502
But if you want to keep this
from happening again,

352
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,550
I suggest that you pull
your team together

353
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:23,136
and solve these cases before
major crimes can step in.

354
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,544
Am I clear?

355
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,554
Yes, sir.
That is definitely clear.

356
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:30,021
Thank you, sir.

357
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,165
You should be frowning.

358
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,599
Why is Jake smi...
Why are you smiling?

359
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,384
Because the Captain just gave us
the perfect revenge plan.

360
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,233
We team up
and solve this case right now!

361
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:41,738
That is not what he meant.

362
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,243
Think about it, Amy.

363
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,522
We go back to the scene
of the crime,

364
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:46,604
find the murder weapon,
and out-vulture the vulture!

365
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:48,749
No one gets in trouble
if we crack the case.

366
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,668
Okay, screw it. I'm in.

367
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,431
Yes! That's right! All right.

368
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,310
We're angry.
We're getting revenge.

369
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:55,602
We're a little bit tipsy.

370
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,272
We should not be driving.
We're taking the bus.

371
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,486
I love the bus!

372
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,410
So the waitress heard
the couple arguing at dinner.

373
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,851
Apparently he was having
an affair,

374
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,740
and it was not the first time.

375
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,076
Two years ago, she caught him
with a dog Walker

376
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,991
who was walking his dog,
if you know what I mean.

377
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,079
- I do.
- Right?

378
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,359
- Yes, I got it.
- Sex times.

379
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,505
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyways, we know it's the wife.

380
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,875
You're real talkative
now that you want our help.

381
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:23,403
All right, it is possible

382
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,580
that I should've brought
you guys in sooner.

383
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,180
But I just get so excited,

384
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,038
wrapped up in wanting
to solve stuff, you know?

385
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,054
I get it.
You want to be the best.

386
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,913
We all do.

387
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:36,786
You just don't have to be
such a butthead about it.

388
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:37,922
What?

389
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:39,475
I just can't believe
you would call me a butthead.

390
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:40,981
- Shut up.
- That's so harsh.

391
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:48,119
Hitchcock farts nonstop.

392
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,105
Still waiting, sergeant.

393
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:52,731
It's just the target looks
exactly like a friend of mine.

394
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,010
It's just freaking me out.

395
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,770
You have a friend...

396
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,533
- Who's just a silhouette?
- Yes.

397
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,486
Let's all just count
to a million.

398
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:00,895
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

399
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:04,032
So then iceman says,
"you can be my wingman any day."

400
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,530
And then Maverick says...
I've seen the film, sergeant.

401
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,161
I haven't. What happens next?

402
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,403
Goose comes back, right?
He's not really dead.

403
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,446
Goose is gone.

404
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,789
- No!
- I know!

405
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,488
All right,
here's how it went down.

406
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,792
9:45, a man screams.

407
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:21,354
90 seconds later,
wife goes down to the doorman,

408
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,042
says a guy murdered her husband
and then ran off.

409
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,612
We know she's lying.

410
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:27,019
We've just got to
find the corkscrew

411
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,462
to make our case airtight.

412
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,894
I say we role-play,
see if something sparks.

413
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,656
Darling, thank you
for a lovely dinner.

414
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,057
Perhaps we should have
one more drink before bed.

415
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:37,362
Don't you
"darling" me, you philanderer.

416
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,730
No, you're the husband.
The husband had the affair.

417
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,235
I'm always the victim.
I don't want to be the victim.

418
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:42,741
Okay, Charles is the door.

419
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,630
No. I'll be the victim.
Don't make me a door again.

420
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:47,222
Great. Okay, so...
Wife goes into the drawer.

421
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:50,647
Gets the corkscrew.
Stab, stab, stab.

422
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,152
What did she do
with the corkscrew?

423
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:53,433
She dumps it
in the hallway trash chute

424
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,585
on the way to the doorman.

425
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,153
No, we checked the trash,
like, ten times.

426
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,755
We would've seen
a bloody corkscrew.

427
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,452
All right, Hitchcock,
you're up.

428
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,806
The body.

429
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,015
The corkscrew's
still in the body.

430
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:07,680
No, you're terrible at this.
Go sit down.

431
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:08,930
You're up, Diaz.

432
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,818
Stab!

433
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,451
Then I...

434
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,796
Toss the corkscrew
out the window,

435
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,044
and it lands on a passing car.

436
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,254
Security cam showed
no one driving by at that time

437
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,502
and nothing on the street.

438
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,416
Okay, I want in.
But I only want to stab you.

439
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,624
Fine. Charles, door.

440
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:25,162
Right.

441
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,003
Okay, uh, sweetheart.

442
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:30,060
Time to die.

443
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,820
That seems a little harsh.

444
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,541
What if it was
a magnetic corkscrew?

445
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,032
If the corkscrew was
on a magnet...

446
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:39,920
It's stuck halfway down
the inside of the trash chute.

447
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,201
I figured it out first!

448
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:42,322
Wow!

449
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:43,729
What's happening?

450
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,524
You have a ten-pound flashlight
in your purse,

451
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,892
but not a hair dryer?

452
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,655
I can't see far enough down.

453
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,062
Someone's gonna have to go
down in there.

454
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,431
Someone with narrow shoulders.

455
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,904
No! I have broad shoulders.

456
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:58,425
I have narrow hips,
but broad shoulders.

457
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,347
God!

458
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,596
See anything?

459
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:03,228
A little lower.

460
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,502
Freeze! Hands in the air!

461
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:06,718
Ahh!

462
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,384
We're cops. Broad shoulders!

463
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:11,296
Stuck! Told you...
Broad shoulders.

464
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,922
Apparently, our Detective squad
has gotten drunk,

465
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,329
compromised the crime scene,

466
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,764
and an officer has gotten stuck
in a trash chute.

467
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,972
I need you to lead
this squad, Terry.

468
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,189
And I mean really lead it.

469
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,120
I hope you take the shot.

470
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,138
What kind of
precinct are you running here?

471
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,385
Would you like to sit down,
Detective?

472
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,306
You seem upset.
Hell yeah, I'm upset.

473
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,676
Your team disrupted
a crime scene

474
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:37,167
over which they have zero...
Zero jurisdiction.

475
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,383
They were publicly drunk.

476
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,920
Apparently one of them pressed

477
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,096
all the buttons
on the elevator.

478
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:43,729
Only, maybe he just bumped up
against the panel

479
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:44,818
with that big white ass of his.

480
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,090
What now?
Holt is gonna kill you.

481
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:48,372
I don't think he will...

482
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:49,749
Because...

483
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,285
Voila!

484
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:53,046
You actually found the corkscrew
in the trash chute?

485
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,638
Stuck to the side,
just like you said.

486
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:58,585
Boyle, we're pulling you out!

487
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,662
This is the proudest moment
of my career.

488
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:06,909
Ah!

489
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,111
Oh, my God, you guys,
we out-vultured the vulture!

490
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,866
What the hell was that?

491
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,241
What? It's a vulture.

492
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,227
Now, if you'll excuse me,

493
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:18,501
I'm gonna take this corkscrew
over to the D.A.

494
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,030
So we get the collar,
not major crimes.

495
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,495
Peralta! Now.

496
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,401
Okay.

497
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,002
- Before you get mad...
- Shut it!

498
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,027
Holt was right.

499
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,242
I've been so worried
about my own kids,

500
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,196
I forgot about
my stupid grown-up kids.

501
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:34,636
That's insulting.

502
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,109
I should've been
on you guys more.

503
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,702
And starting now, I will be.

504
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,976
But if you ever do this again,

505
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,602
I swear I will crush your head
in one hand.

506
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,202
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

507
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:46,771
Okay.

508
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,813
Where you going?

509
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,126
The boss is taking heat

510
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:52,822
for something
that's not even his fault.

511
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,455
I can't let that happen.

512
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,856
Wait. Damn it.

513
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,385
Look, it's not
your fault either.

514
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:03,387
And it's not
the vulture's fault.

515
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:04,604
It's Amy's.

516
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,917
I know. I know. It's mine.

517
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,454
It's mine, okay?

518
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,950
God, I do not love
how this worked out.

519
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:13,377
Detective Pembroke.

520
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,656
Now what?

521
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,386
I'd like to cordially invite you
to calm down,

522
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,923
especially considering
that this case

523
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,429
has already been solved...

524
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,742
By you!

525
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:23,545
Looks like you found
the murder weapon.

526
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,896
It's a good thing you realized
it was magnetically stuck

527
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,209
to the inside
of the trash chute.

528
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,097
Congratulations.

529
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,331
Cracked the case
all by yourself.

530
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:33,611
We done here?

531
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,895
Yeah. Yeah, we're done here.

532
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,649
Hey, keep up
the bad work, champ.

533
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,530
Here it comes.

534
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,657
Why does he keep
touching my butt?

535
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,646
- Stay foxy.
- Die lonely.

536
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,273
Well, case closed.
Good work, everyone.

537
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:55,513
Let's, uh, call it a night
without any further discussion.

538
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,890
No!

539
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,363
All of you broke
into a crime scene

540
00:18:58,395 --> 00:18:59,931
under the influence of alcohol,

541
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,652
overstepped your jurisdiction,
and disobeyed my direct orders.

542
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,829
Everyone involved tonight
is gonna get written up.

543
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:06,366
Okay, fine.

544
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,352
Here's everyone who was there.

545
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,687
Jake Peralta, J. Peralta,

546
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,290
Dr. Jacob Peralta,

547
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,273
who has a PhD
in slow-jam studies

548
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:16,227
from funktown state university,

549
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:19,462
also involved was the right
honorable J... okay, enough.

550
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,573
My point is it was
a Peralta special, sir.

551
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:22,727
No one else was there.

552
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,320
Well, Detective,
I'm happy to see

553
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,850
you're learning how to be
part of a team.

554
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:31,274
Everybody go home.
Sleep it off.

555
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,309
Sir? Thank you.

556
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,805
Ultimately, it was
our raw sexual chemistry

557
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:40,719
that helped him overcome
his crippling fear.

558
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
You should just stay
in the office all day every day

559
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,297
and be my bestie.

560
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,180
You could join
my dance troupe, floorgasm.

561
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,548
We're looking for a man
of precisely your...

562
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,782
It's gonna be a long road,

563
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:55,800
but I'm ready to get myself
back in the game.

564
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,855
I know you will.

565
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,033
I mean, eventually...

566
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,145
Not tonight.

567
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,842
I need to go hug my baby girls.

568
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:05,052
Excuse me.

569
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,477
Jake, I have to say,
the way you handled things

570
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,398
with the vulture yesterday
was very mature.

571
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,999
Well, sometimes in life,

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,952
you just have to take
the high road.

573
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:15,489
Oop! Time's up!

574
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:17,314
- Can't wait to see it.
- Ah, here we go.

575
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,203
- That's good suction.
- Oh!

576
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,643
Ooh!

577
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:21,731
Check it out!

578
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,293
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah!

579
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,854
"Dear vulture,

580
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:30,758
"enjoy my big white ass.

581
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:31,976
Jake."

582
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,544
Here you are.

583
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,147
Always take the high road,
Charles.

584
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,651
Always take the high road.

9999

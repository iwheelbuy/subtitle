Fine.

163
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,310
I guess I can help you
with those at-risk kids.

164
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,745
[Scoffs]
I don't need your help.

165
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,213
It's nothing personal,
it's just...

166
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,715
You're not a cop,
so I'm not really sure

167
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:40,849
- you could help.
- Okay.

168
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,850
No hard feelings.

169
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,017
But I hate you.

170
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,786
Not joking. Bye.

171
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,022
[Distant siren]

172
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,624
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.

173
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,058
I'm glad you're here.

174
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,727
May I present to you...
[Imitates trumpet fanfare]

175
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:55,530
Oh, my darlings.
Thank God I found you.

176
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,467
Oh, look at
those beautiful cheeks.

177
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:00,102
I have no idea
who this lady is.

178
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:02,237
I've never seen her
before in my life.

179
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,405
What?
No, she recognized you.

180
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,473
This is Helen.
Who's Helen?

181
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:09,141
Oh! That's my husband.

182
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,776
Solomon!

183
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,577
I'm... I'm not really
her husband.

184
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:15,580
You're so much shorter
than you used to be.

185
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,783
What did the Japanese
do to you?

186
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,518
Different generation.

187
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,687
Okay, this
is Ethel Musterberg

188
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:23,756
from the prospect heights
senior center.

189
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,958
There was an I.D. card
in her back pocket.

190
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,927
Why was your hand
in her back pocket?

191
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:30,196
Well, she told me
she didn't have any I.D.,

192
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,698
and, unlike Boyle,
my first instinct

193
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,499
was not to caress
her butt.

194
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,034
Frisked!
I frisked her butt!

195
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:39,037
It looks like this case
remains unsolved, Peralta.

196
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:41,406
Oh, my God.

197
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,475
I'm in a slump!

198
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,736
Oh, cool. You're all here
in the break room.

199
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,076
You asked us
to come in here.

200
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,140
What? Here's
a hypothetical question.

201
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:53,608
Let's say
I knew someone

202
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,076
that, for the first time
in their career,

203
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:57,879
was experiencing,
like, a minor slump.

204
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,180
What do you think
you would suggest

205
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:01,082
to that person if they
were going through that?

206
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,852
Well, I haven't really been
in a slump since my divorce.

207
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,255
So I'd tell this person,
"maybe get divorced."

208
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,723
He'd have to
get married first.

209
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,091
Okay, so the suggestion
to beat

210
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,059
is get married
and then divorced.

211
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,327
Rosa?

212
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,928
Fly to Montreal,
hit a classy hotel bar,

213

bone a stranger,
slump over.

214
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:16,965
Wow, that sounds
amazing.

215
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,966
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.

216
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,167
Sarge, what would
you do?

217
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,335
10,000 sit-ups.

218
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,737
Okay, do you have
a backup plan

219
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:24,273
in case my hypothetical
person can only do

220
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:26,375
9,500, or 3?

221
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,877
What's going on
in here?

222

We're helping Jake's friend
got out of his slump.

223
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,348
Or try working a case
until it's solved, Peralta.

224
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,584
I always find
that closing cases

225
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:37,186
is the best way
to end the slump.

226
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,588
Thank you, Captain!
He's right.

227

You just need a win.

Pick your easiest,
no-brainer case,

229

and work it
till it's done.

Fine!

Rosa's Montreal sex thing.

That sounds fun.
Yeah.

233

Okay, this is
the Junior police program.

Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

237
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:05,047
is to get your life
back on track.

What are you doing?
Oh, hi, Amy.

241
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,254
Since I have nothing to offer,
and since I'm not a cop,

242
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,323
I thought I'd just
show up and learn.

243

Do you wanna
help me out here?

Nah, I think I'm good.

245

I know you think
getting in trouble is cool.

246
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:23,066
But let me show you
what can happen

247
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,001
if you continue
down this path.

248
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,736
Hey, yo,
I'm an at-risk kid,

249
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,737
and I think it's cool
to sell drugs.

250
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:30,806
Hold up... why does
the kid selling drugs

sound like he's black?

He's not.
Well, why not?

253
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,411
Are you saying that
black people can't sell drugs?

254
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,146
No, I'm not saying that.

sell drugs?

tomorrow.

I told my wife
I'd get it done.

269
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,478
I had the same exact one
when I was a kid!

my doll house!

- No! I can do this.

It's just driving me
a little crazy.

274
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:25,327
Where do I affix
the princess tower, Boyle?

275
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:28,030
- Where do I affix it?
- On the side of the turret...

276
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,732
Not now, Boyle.

Let a brother breathe.

279
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,306
Why would I swap cases
with you?

280
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,642
I got multiple calls that
a guy in the sackett towers

281
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,577
is dealing meth
out of his apartment.

282
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,878
It's a guaranteed arrest.

283
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,013
And therefore will have
a ton of paperwork,

284
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:46,849
which I know you hate.

285
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,150
I have a murder here
with no leads

286
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,318
and no evidence.

287
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:52,221
It's unsolvable,
and thus...

288
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,656
Shall have no paperwork.

289
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,125
You had me
at "no paperwork."

290
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,861
That was the very end
of the sentence.

291
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,529
All right, Boyle.

to ending the slump.

Nothin' but net.

296
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,536
Hey, slump,
you're about to get

297
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,171
nailed by the Jake hammer.

298
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,892
So you haven't solved
any of your old cases,

299
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,541
and yet you've
taken on a new one.

300
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,909
I mean, shouldn't you
at least solve

301
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,011
this Helen Sterrino missing
grandmother case first?

302
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:17,513
Or I could solve
the super easy one,

303
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:19,214
get my mojo back,
and move on to catching

305
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:21,283
Am I getting ahead
of myself?

00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:22,451
No, you are not,

Let's go. Ah.

308
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,724
I did not think
getting these kids

309
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,885
to sign up
would be this hard.

310

don't wanna listen to you.

Why am I offended by that?

They don't
identify with you

315
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,734
because you're not
from the streets. I am.

you're badasses.

you're scared.

He thought he was cursed,

402

and because cops
are superstitious,

403

the whole precinct
thought he was cursed.

But then he found a case,
and he solved it,

will that be?

- Wrong.

00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,264
I guess I can help you
with those at-risk kids.

164
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,642
[Scoffs]
I don't need your help.

165
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,052
It's nothing personal,
it's just...

166
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,454
You're not a cop,
so I'm not really sure

167
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:27,544
- you could help.
- Okay.

168
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,506
No hard feelings.

169
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:29,626
But I hate you.

170
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,325
Not joking. Bye.

171
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:33,471
[Distant siren]

172
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,011
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.

173
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,388
I'm glad you're here.

174
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:37,991
May I present to you...
[Imitates trumpet fanfare]

175
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:41,643
Oh, my darlings.
Thank God I found you.

176
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:44,464
Oh, look at
those beautiful cheeks.

177
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,034
I have no idea
who this lady is.

178
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:48,084
I've never seen her
before in my life.

179
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:50,167
What?
No, she recognized you.

180
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,153
This is Helen.
Who's Helen?

181
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,715
Oh! That's my husband.

182
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,286
Solomon!

183
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,015
I'm... I'm not really
her husband.

184
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,900
You're so much shorter
than you used to be.

185
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,015
What did the Japanese
do to you?

186
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,682
Different generation.

187
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,764
Okay, this
is Ethel Musterberg

188
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,751
from the prospect heights
senior center.

189
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,865
There was an I.D. card
in her back pocket.

190
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,757
Why was your hand
in her back pocket?

191
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,936
Well, she told me
she didn't have any I.D.,

192
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:16,379
and, unlike Boyle,
my first instinct

193
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,107
was not to caress
her butt.

194
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,543
Frisked!
I frisked her butt!

195
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:23,427
It looks like this case
remains unsolved, Peralta.

196
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,701
Oh, my God.

197
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,689
I'm in a slump!

198
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:32,742
Oh, cool. You're all here
in the break room.

199
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,028
You asked us
to come in here.

200
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:36,011
What? Here's
a hypothetical question.

201
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,420
Let's say
I knew someone

202
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,830
that, for the first time
in their career,

203
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,522
was experiencing,
like, a minor slump.

204
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:42,772
What do you think
you would suggest

205
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:44,598
to that person if they
were going through that?

206
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,258
Well, I haven't really been
in a slump since my divorce.

207
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,566
So I'd tell this person,
"maybe get divorced."

208
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,976
He'd have to
get married first.

209
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,290
Okay, so the suggestion
to beat

210
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,179
is get married
and then divorced.

211
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,397
Rosa?

212
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,936
Fly to Montreal,
hit a classy hotel bar,

213

bone a stranger,
slump over.

214
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,852
Wow, that sounds
amazing.

215
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,814
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.

216
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:01,967
Sarge, what would
you do?

217
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,088
10,000 sit-ups.

218
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,435
Okay, do you have
a backup plan

219
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,871
in case my hypothetical
person can only do

220
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,889
9,500, or 3?

221
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:10,332
What's going on
in here?

222
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:12,575
We're helping Jake's friend
got out of his slump.

223
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:14,625
Or try working a case
until it's solved, Peralta.

224
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,774
I always find
that closing cases

225
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,272
is the best way
to end the slump.

226
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,579
Thank you, Captain!
He's right.

227
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,957
You just need a win.

00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,367
Pick your easiest,
no-brainer case,

229

and work it
till it's done.

Fine!

Rosa's Montreal sex thing.

That sounds fun.
Yeah.

233

Okay, this is
the Junior police program.

Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

237
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:46,029
is to get your life
back on track.

What are you doing?
Oh, hi, Amy.

241
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,951
Since I have nothing to offer,
and since I'm not a cop,

242
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,938
I thought I'd just
show up and learn.

243

Do you wanna
help me out here?

Nah, I think I'm good.

245

I know you think
getting in trouble is cool.

246
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:03,334
But let me show you
what can happen

247
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,193
if you continue
down this path.

248
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,859
Hey, yo,
I'm an at-risk kid,

249
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,781
and I think it's cool
to sell drugs.

250

Hold up... why does
the kid selling drugs

sound like he's black?

He's not.
Well, why not?

253
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:16,150
Are you saying that
black people can't sell drugs?

254
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,817
No, I'm not saying that.

sell drugs?

tomorrow.

I told my wife
I'd get it done.

269
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,868
I had the same exact one
when I was a kid!

my doll house!

- No! I can do this.

It's just driving me
a little crazy.

274
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,128
Where do I affix
the princess tower, Boyle?

275
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:05,725
- Where do I affix it?
- On the side of the turret...

276
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,359
Not now, Boyle.

Let a brother breathe.

Let a brother breathe.

279
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,633
Why would I swap cases
with you?

280
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,877
I got multiple calls that
a guy in the sackett towers

281
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,734
is dealing meth
out of his apartment.

282
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:19,984
It's a guaranteed arrest.

283
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,035
And therefore will have
a ton of paperwork,

284
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,798
which I know you hate.

285
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,048
I have a murder here
with no leads

286
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,169
and no evidence.

287
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,958
It's unsolvable,
and thus...

288
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,335
Shall have no paperwork.

289
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,707
You had me
at "no paperwork."

290
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,373
That was the very end
of the sentence.

291
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,976
All right, Boyle.

to ending the slump.

Nothin' but net.

296
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:43,666
Hey, slump,
you're about to get

297
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,236
nailed by the Jake hammer.

298
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,888
So you haven't solved
any of your old cases,

299
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,473
and yet you've
taken on a new one.

300
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,787
I mean, shouldn't you
at least solve

301
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,805
this Helen Sterrino missing
grandmother case first?

302
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:53,248
Or I could solve
the super easy one,

303
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,880
get my mojo back,
and move on to catching

305
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:56,869
Am I getting ahead
of myself?

306
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,989
No, you are not,

I like Jake hammer better.
Let's go. Ah.

308
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,014
I did not think
getting these kids

309
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:05,130
to sign up
would be this hard.

310

don't wanna listen to you.

So are you!

00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:11,736
Why am I offended by that?

314

They don't
identify with you

315
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,588
because you're not
from the streets. I am.

you're badasses.

you're scared.

How do I know?

321
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:26,766
Because I've been
that same scared kid.

322
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,754
And if you don't get
your crap together,

323
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:31,285
I'm gonna end up busting you
and throwing you in jail.

324
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,529
Got it?

325
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,419
Remix, yo!

326
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,828
[Autotuned singing]
â™ª Throwing you in jail

327
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,430
â™ª Throwing you in jail
[Laughter]

328
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,712
â™ª Got it?

329
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:40,994
â™ª Throwing you in jail

330
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:41,988
What's happening?

331
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,526
I think they're
laughing at you.

332
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,282
That's never
happened before.

333
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:48,585
I don't like it.
â™ª got it?

334
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:53,363
Freeze!

335
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,677
NYPD, hands where
I can see them.

336
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:56,215
Don't shoot!
I was just practicing

337
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:57,882
my minuets,
but I'll hold it down.

338
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,931
All right, flute man,
who else is in this apartment?

339
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,470
Where's the dealer?
I live here alone

340
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,655
with my birds.

341
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,033
What, you don't think
I know this M.O.?

342
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,219
These are mules.

343
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,340
They're drug mules.

344
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,975
They're bird mule drugs.

345
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,001
Drug bird mules.

346
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,250
Apartment's clear.

347
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,825
We got multiple calls
about a dealer here.

348
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,033
I bet it's the silly kids
down the hall.

349
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,762
They love prank calling me.

350
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,365
The only drugs
in this apartment

351
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,030
are for my heart,
my liver,

352
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:21,274
my kidney,
my salivary glands,

353
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:22,715
and my penis and my feet.

354
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:26,537
Oh, bird pooped
on your shoulder.

355
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,781
No, wait...
Pooped on your head,

356
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:32,114
then dripped
onto your shoulder.

357
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,262
<i>I'm telling you,
it's good luck.</i>

358
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,543
No, it isn't, okay?

359
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,858
That's just something
people say

360
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,747
when a bird poops on you
to make you feel better

361
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,029
because it's terrible.

362
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,080
Fore, comin' in!

363
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:44,611
Oh, come on.
I was at the crime scene.

364
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:47,335
This guy comes up
out of nowhere, confesses.

365
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,714
Well, he says he's gotta
make things right,

366
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,149
so helps me track down
his accomplices.

367
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,745
That is so great, man.

368
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,109
Looks like everything's
comin' up Hitchcock.

369
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:00,217
Hey, Jake.
You busy?

370
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,620
Yes, I very clearly am busy.

371
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:05,152
The medical examiner's office
just called.

372
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,626
They mishandled
some evidence.

373
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,671
So the D.A.'s gonna have
to dismiss your last two busts.

374
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:10,792
[Sighs]
Great.

375
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,363
And the slump gets worse.

376
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,612
I don't think
it's a slump.

377
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,663
Honestly, you are
straight-up cursed.

378
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,169
Good to know.

379
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:28,993
Can you hand me
a paper towel, please, Gina?

380
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,295
There's no more left.

381
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,288
Yeah, that sounds right.

382
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,132
Hey.

383
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,791
You're dripping
on my carpet.

384
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,162
Oh, don't worry, sir.
It's just urinal water.

385
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:43,572
Clean urinal water.

386
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:44,950
You could eat
off his shirt.

387
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,585
Why would I ever
eat off his shirt?

388
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,508
Look, sir, I don't know
what's going on,

389
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,822
but I think I'm cursed.

390
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:50,878
Cursed, huh?

391
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,193
The freakiest things
have been happening to me.

392
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,924
I mean, I can't solve a case
to save my life.

393
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,654
Birds are unloading on me
left and right.

394
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,064
And, two seconds ago...

395
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,178
Hey, sarge, do we have
any old t-shirts in here? I...

396
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,748
Cursed.

397
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,991
Yeah, I've seen
this kind of thing before.

398
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,818
It happened to a friend
of mine back in the 1-8.

399
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,098
<i>Detective Smith.</i>

400
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,316
We called him smitty.

401
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,471
He thought he was cursed,

402
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:15,681
and because cops
are superstitious,

403
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:17,123
the whole precinct
thought he was cursed.

404
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,598
But then he found a case,
and he solved it,

405
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,815
and now he's married
to Kate Upton.

406
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,673
<i>No. No one would go out
on calls with him.</i>

407
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:24,077
He responded to a riot
at a gym without backup,

408
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,808
and got beaten up
by a girls' volleyball team.

409
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,339
It was actually
quite violent.

410
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,364
<i>Man...</i>

411
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,447
Girls are so scary.

412
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,531
<i>I don't want you out
in the field again, Peralta.</i>

413
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,588
I'm pulling you
from casework.

414
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,870
You can digitize old files
with Scully.

415
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,992
You're benching me?

416
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,753
No, no, no, look...
I've got a plan.

417
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,581
Give all my open cases
to Hitchcock,

418
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:41,606
who's suddenly
on a roll,

419
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,664
and assign me
20 fresh ones.

420
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:44,041
Eventually,
my luck will turn.

421
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,163
No, I don't think
that's what's best for you

422
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,188
or the squad.

423
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,245
Not until this blows over.

424
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:48,271
And how long
will that be?

425
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,521
Could be a week,

426
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:50,643
could be a month.

427
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,661
Could be a year.
Could be a decade.

428
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:56,250
Sorry, we're just saying
bigger and bigger numbers.

429
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,141
I don't know how to connect
with these kids.

430
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:01,057
They're mean and shallow
and respect nothing.

431
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:02,979
I mean, what kind of person
would they even listen to?

432
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,158
Hitchcock, stop bringing
your food

433
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,441
in little
Tupperware containers.

434
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:08,331
It hurts my fingers
when I'm trying to open it.

435
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,389
<i>(Hitchcock)
Sorry!</i>

436
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:14,804
Hey, Gina.
That's a super cute...

437
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:15,765
What do you want?

438
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,464
Sweater.
Okay.

439
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,001
Rosa and I think
it would be great

440
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,444
if you talked to the kids.

441
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,528
Mm, I thought
only cops could help.

442
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,937
In this case,
not being a cop

443
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:25,603
might actually be better.
Mm, that's true.

444
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:28,327
In all cases,
cops are the worst.

445
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,301
"Enter the numbers
from this report

446
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,287
"into the corresponding boxes
on the screen.

447
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,312
Then fill out these fields."

448
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:36,755
And I'm in a coma.

449
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,390
Hey, Hitchcock.

450
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,799
<i>Help me out, man.
I'm so bored.</i>

451
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,081
Let me jump back
on that murder with you.

452
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:42,908
No. I got it.

453
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,286
Come on, man,
let me just...

454
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:45,247
No, don't touch it!
You're contagious.

455
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,914
Everything could fall apart!

456
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,227
Geraldo, leave
Hitchcock alone!

457
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>Come here.</i>

458
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,329
I got in touch
with smitty.

459
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,899
He says that you should
rub this rabbit's foot

460
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,692
with your left forefinger
and your pinky,

461
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,001
like this, for good luck.

462
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,763
Okay? Now you try it.

463
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,006
Okay.

464
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:03,608
Yep.

465
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,570
It's definitely helping.

466
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,012
I can feel it.

467
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,319
The curse is lifting
off of me.

468
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,826
Ah, hand cramp!

469
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,107
Rub, rub, rub.

470
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,318

You okay?

473
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,694
The fairy princess castle

a dollhouse in less
than four hours.

478
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,596
Why does it have
to be so hard?

479
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,378

He needs everybody back.

There's a lead on

We're looking for a white male,

with my husband.

We wove hats
out of Palm fronds

the stingrays.

what killed him.

144

Just like his mouth was,

Boyle, see what
you can find in the bedroom.

155
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:09,262
I'll take the kitchen.

156
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:11,536
Yep, that's exactly
what I was gonna say.

157
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,529
It's... it's so weird.

158
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,586
He's so good at knowing

159
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:14,676
what I'm gonna
tell him to do,

160
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:18,681
he just does it.
It's weird.

161
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,179
Hey, sergeant.

162
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,102
You know how
you're really good at doodling?

163
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,216
I know you think
you're complimenting me,

164
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:27,491
but calling them doodles
is an insult.

165
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,798
You a big fan
of Picasso's doodles?

166
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,495
Sorry.

167
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,809
Can you please
draw a perp for me?

168
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,963
The sketch artist
is out sick

169
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,533
and the Captain
wants this done right away.

170
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,623
He's in a bad mood.

171
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:37,616
Is he?

172
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:39,826
I can never read him.

173
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,300
You look chipper, Captain.

174
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:42,260
You have a fun weekend?

175
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,246
There was a small fire
in my home.

176
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:48,126
I lost many photo albums
of treasured memories.

177
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,597
I'm devastated.

178
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm telling you,

179
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,192
he and I have a connection

180
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,666
and there is something
bothering him.

181
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,555
Can you help me out?

182
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,221
Great.

183
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,663
Ma'am, can you please
describe the perp

184
00:05:58,664 --> 00:05:59,881
to sergeant Jeffords?

185
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:02,220
Yeah, he had,
um, dark, curly hair,

186
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,469
and a neck tattoo...

187
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,686
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

188
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,994
Let's start with the eyes.

189
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,428
Were they desperate?
Lonely?

190
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:10,518
Did they betray heartache?

191
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,959
They were brown.

192
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,874
Do you even
want your purse back?

193
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:18,847
So far you've managed
to tell three fat jokes

194
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,288
and completely
bulldoze Charles.

195
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,858
Is that your idea
of being a good secondary?

196
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,780
First off,
I've told four.

197
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,350
And second,
I'm helping.

198
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,464
I mean, I started cataloguing
the contents of the fridge,

199
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,938
but it turns out there's not
enough paper on earth.

200
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,573
Five fat jokes.

201
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:31,566
- Thanks, Arnie.
- [Laughs]

202
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,689
See, Arnie thinks
I'm doing great.

203
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,746
Arnie, shut up.

204
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:36,693
Jake, for once,
just hang back

205
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,551
and let Boyle do his job.

206
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,153
[Groans]
Fine.

207
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:42,460
Unless I get a direct order
from Boyle

208
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,158
I will stand
here motionless

209
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,170
like a wise,
old oak tree.

210
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,733
You look like an idiot.

211
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,391
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Patterson.

212
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,570
Can you talk about
what happened after breakfast?

213
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,819
I took the dog
for a walk.

214
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,485
When I came back,
he was dead.

215
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,969
I'm just in shock.

216
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,138
We were going on a cruise
together next week.

217
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,896
He had pre-purchased
the unlimited soda package.

218
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:06,232
I'm sure the soft drink industry
mourns his passing.

219
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:14,209
Motion reactivated.

220
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:15,716
Hey.

221
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:16,901
Detective Jake Peralta.

222
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,920
Dr. Rossi.
I'm the new medical examiner.

223
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,945
Don't let me
get in your way.

224
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,060
I'm sure
you have a lot to do.

225
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,668
Actually, I've been given
a direct order

226
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,526
to do nothing, so.

227
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,225
What brings you here...

228
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,627
Okay.
All right.

229
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,133
Sorry.
Sorry.

230
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,010
- You all right?
- What's up?

231
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:38,497
How's the Patterson case
looking?

232
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,033
It looks like
natural causes,

233
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,186
but I'll know for sure
once I get

234
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:42,532
the autopsy results
tomorrow.

235
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,934
Jake volunteered to follow up
with the M.E.

236
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,441
My man is all over it.

237
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:48,828
I'm really glad you could
sneak away from your case.

238
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,727
Well, it's technically
not really my case,

239
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,219
but on the plus side, I have
all the time in the world.

240
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,724
- Oh.
- To you.

241
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,711
And to the ginormous,
dead fat man

242
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,345
- who brought us together.
- [Laughs]

243
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,151
(Boyle)
Hey, Jake.

244
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,176
Have you heard anything
from the M.E.?

245
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:10,554
She hasn't sent
the autopsy report.

246
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:11,931
Oh, that's strange.

247
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,597
Maybe probably
a bunch more people died

248
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,847
and she got super busy?

249
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,872
That's definitely
what happened.

250
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:17,859
Okay, just let me know
when she calls.

251
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,396
You got it.

252
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,030
[Clears throat]

253
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,632
Hey, can I
ask you guys something?

254
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,624
Can you keep a secret?

255
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,874
Do you know anything
about my life?

256
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,027
No, I do not.
Good point.

257
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,853
Okay, so you know the new
medical examiner?

258
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,840
I kinda had sex
with her last night.

259
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,441
What?

260
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:33,235
Oh, sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

261
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,157
Sex is something that two adults
do with their bodies

262
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,470
when they're attracted
to each other.

263
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,084
He's right, Santiago.
Do you not know that?

264
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,796
I meant,
what were you thinking?

265
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,429
She was supposed
to be doing an autopsy

266
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,128
for your primary, Charles.

267
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,377
The guy died
of natural causes.

268
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:46,434
What's the big deal?

269
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:47,748
Anyways,
back to last night.

270
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,286
As you would imagine,
I'm normally up

271
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,856
for pretty much anything
in the bedroom,

272
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:54,122
but I can't tell if what
happened was weird or sexy.

273
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,109
Wait.
Close your eyes.

274
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,402
Oh, okay.

275
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,363
- [Yelps]
- Shh.

276
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:04,213
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

277
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,271
What are you doing?

278
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,514
I like 'em cold.

279
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,860
Okay...

280
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:09,821
Not that weird.

281
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,262
Cold?
Like a dead guy?

282
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:12,383
You're reading into that.

283
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:13,537
Am I?

284
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,363
You have a really nice chest.

285
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:16,645
Thank you.

286
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:18,022
I'd love to crack it open

287
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,265
and get my hands
all over your organs.

288
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,642
Okay...

289
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:22,827
I wonder how much
your appendix weighs.

290
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,718
[Gasps]
Oh.

291
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,000
It's inflamed.

292
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,153
All right.

293
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:28,243
Wait, that's bad,
right?

294
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:29,844
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, no.

295
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:30,997
Ew!

296
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:32,471
Please tell me
you ran out of there.

297
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,425
No.

298
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:37,244
For some reason
I kinda started getting into it.

299
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,520
Oh, what do we have here?

300
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:42,723
A 34-year-old caucasian male
who is dead.

301
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,684
Very dead.

302
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:44,709
Mmm.

303
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,799
Cause of death?

304
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,586
Initial assessment:
Blunt force trauma.

305
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,957
But what do I find when I probe
a little farther?

306
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,398
Bruising around the neck.

307
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,802
And ocean water
in the lungs.

308
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,076
Ooh, how long
have you been dead, body?

309
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,101
Four days.

310
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:59,607
Gross.
Bloating. Odors.

311
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,946
Oh, uh, 24 hours.

312
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:03,900
Perfect.

313
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,598
Here we go.

314
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,968
Stop, stop, stop!
Weird, weird, weird!

315
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,730
Rosa, what's your call?
Weird or sexy?

316
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:10,723
Weird.

317
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:11,908
I knew it.

318
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,119
- But also kinda sexy?
- No. Weird.

319
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,689
But more importantly,
that's what you were doing

320
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,034
while Charles was grinding
through paperwork?

321
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,477
Told ya.

322
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:19,597
Worst secondary
in the unit.

323
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:21,104
What do you guys
want from me?

324
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,929
You know, I take over a crime
scene, I'm a bad secondary.

325
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,660
I blow off work to have sex
with a hot coroner,

326
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm a bad secondary.

327
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:26,742
I can't win.

328
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:27,703
What are you guys
talking about?

329
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:29,049
Um, just weird
sex stuff

330
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,234
that has nothing
to do with work.

331
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,219
I once had sex
on a futon.

332
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,326
And it was in couch mode.

333
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,249
Hmm.

334
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:42,119
Sarge, all of these
are fine.

335
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,368
How much longer are you
gonna work on this?

336
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,874
It's questions like that

337
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,764
that made Van Gogh
cut off his ear.

338
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:49,584
You can't put a clock
on art.

339
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,026
Ten minutes.

340
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:51,987
Great.

341
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:52,980
Let's catch this guy

342
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,165
so we can give Holt
some good news.

343
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,286
I wanna cheer him up.

344
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,760
Well, how do you
even know he's in a bad mood?

345
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,939
I mean, it's impossible
to read that guy.

346
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,502
This is the most incompetent,
worthless report

347
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,359
I have ever read
in my life!

348
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,731
Get your act together
or, so help me God,

349
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,229
you won't live
to see retirement!

350
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,344
It's like,
"what's that guy thinking?"

351
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,305
You know?

352
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,651
I can read him.

353
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:13,675
And if anyone
can figure out

354
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:15,534
what's bothering him,
it's me.

355
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:17,392
He and I
are exactly the same.

356
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,571
Except that I'm younger,
Cuban,

357
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,884
female, single,
and straight.

358
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:23,384
Captain Holt's
not gay.

359
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,377
Captain Holt's gay?

360
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:27,261
Seriously, man,
just retire.

361
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:31,008
Boyle, where's my paperwork
on that DOA?

362
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,322
Still waiting on
the autopsy report.

363
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:33,540
Supposed to come in
first thing this morning,

364
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,847
- but so far, nothing.
- This is unacceptable.

365
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:37,673
I'll call the M.E.
and find out what happened.

366
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,076
Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah.

367
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,709
That's not necessary, sir.

368
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,048
For the record, I think it's
natural causes anyway,

369
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,971
but I'm also
the secondary in this case.

370
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:48,148
It's my responsibility,
so I will head on down there

371
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,109
and pick up the report.

372
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,264
Good.

373
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:51,705
But don't ever
bup-bup-bup-bup me again.

374
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:52,666
Right,
I don't know...

375
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,941
Bup-bup-bup-bup...
Bup-bup-bup.

376
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,287
Just go.

377
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,945
Yep, I am going to regret
teaching him that one.

378
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:02,149
Rosa, can I
show you something?

379
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,335
What's up?

380
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,809
Patterson's wife told me

381
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,827
that they were going
on a cruise together next month,

382
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,101
but her credit card bill shows
only one ticket booked.

383
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:12,593
Either she's lying
or she knew he was gonna die.

384
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,836
Huh, nice find, Boyle.

385
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,277
This could be a murder.

386
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,559
Where's that autopsy?

387
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,225
Jake went down to the M.E.
an hour and a half ago.

388
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:20,570
He still hasn't
got back to me.

389
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,044
Jake went to get
the autopsy report?

390
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,351
I know.
Isn't he the best?

391
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,626
I mean, he's really coming into
his own as a secondary.

392
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,485
I wanna get him
a thank you present.

393
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,182
Does he come across more
as a Pinot guy

394
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,336
or more of a Shiraz?

395
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,489
You know what?

396
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,514
We better go down there.

397
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,796
See what's holding him up.

398
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,167
Good call.

399
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,498
Detectives.
[Clears throat]

400
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,460
Hello.

401
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,773
Shirt's buttoned wrong.

402
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:45,529
(Dr. Rossi) Huh.
So it is.

403
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,586
Well, how can I help you?

404
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,380
Uh, we came by
to get that autopsy report.

405
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,398
- Hmm.
- Is Detective Peralta here?

406
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,904
I haven't seen him.

407
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,026
Thanks for coming by.

408
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:53,987
(Peralta)
[Coughing]

409
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,927
Hold on.

410
00:12:57,928 --> 00:12:59,496
Found him.

411
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:01,611
Ah, thank goodness
you're here.

412
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,758
I am so lost.

413
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,193
Do you know where
the vending machines are?

414
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:10,111
Look, it's not
what it seems like.

415
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:11,168
Yes, it is.

416
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,225
Yes, it is.
Here's what happened.

417
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,051
I came down here
to get the autopsy report

418
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,389
and in conclusion,
here we are.

419
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,544
Now if you'll
excuse me...

420
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:18,761
Cut the crap, Peralta.

421
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:20,875
Look, I'm sorry I slowed down
the autopsy results,

422
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,509
but everyone knows
it's natural causes.

423
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,239
Not anymore.
We think it could be a murder.

424
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,328
Wait,
like a murder murder,

425
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,674
or, like,
his mouth murdered him

426
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:27,635
by making him
eat so much food

427
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:28,596
that his heart exploded?

428
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:29,557
Murder murder.

429
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,430
We need the autopsy
to be sure.

430
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:32,601
I have not gotten
to that yet.

431
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,331
You guys have been down here
for two hours.

432
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,510
What, did you
have sex 40 times?

433
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,726
40 times?

434
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
No, Charles,
like...

435
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:39,969
Look, I'm sorry.

436
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,122
We didn't know
it was a homicide.

437
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,308
Well, it shouldn't matter.

438
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,941
I'm your primary
and I asked you to do something.

439
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,408
So if it's okay,
I'd like to be upset with you.

440
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,690
It's more than okay.

441
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:48,972
It's okay times two.

442
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,509
Now, Dr. Rossi,

443
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:53,175
will you please perform
the autopsy for us right now?

444
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,802
Actually,
with a body this size,

445
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:55,923
I'd need my assistant,

446
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,070
and I gave him
the rest of the afternoon off

447
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,031
when Jake showed up.

448
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,904
Guilty.

449
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,459
Okay, fine.

450
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,734
I will act
as your assistant

451
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,328
because I am
a wonderful secondary.

452
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:08,866
How gross could it be?

453
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,148
Just gonna need you
to hold open

454
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,006
this chest cavity
for me.

455
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
Oh.
Wow.

456
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,171
Okay, I can do that.
It's no big deal.

457
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,670
Just like holding open
some slimy elevator doors.

458
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:21,585
For a family of aliens...
Oh, my God.

459
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,565
Yep, there are some signs
of stress on the heart,

460
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:25,751
but that's not surprising.

461
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:28,282
Oh, will you look
at that stomach lining?

462
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,499
God,
that is just a beaut.

463
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,942
Ugh.

464
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:31,934
All right.

465
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,896
I'm gonna need you
to go ahead

466
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:33,857
and take your hand...

467
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:34,818
[Groans]

468
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,227
- Yep, get it down there.
- [Groans]

469
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,253
Get it down there.

470
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,214
Get it on in.

471
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:39,495
- [Groans]
- There you go.

472
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,585
Oh, that is so big.

473
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,301
- Caught him?
- Yes, sir.

474
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,423
He was easy to pick up.

475
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:47,409
He looked just like
the sergeant's sketch.

476
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:49,012
You could be
a professional artist, boss.

477
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,421
Like on the boardwalk.

478
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,888
You think I should
draw caricatures?

479
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,138
That's garbage art!

480
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,413
I don't draw giant-head people
on surfboards!

481
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,199
I'm saying you could.
You're that good.

482
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,282
Captain, the credit really goes
to sergeant Jeffords.

483
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,396
Without his refined
artistic skills...

484
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,709
Finish the paperwork
by noon.

485
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,041
I want it included
in the crime stats.

486
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,579
I gotta say, I always hate
how I look in pictures,

487
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,021
but that is so flattering.

488
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,527
Also, I'm innocent.

489
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,488
You got the wrong guy.

490
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:14,578
Shut up.

491
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,045
Sarge, I need you to do
one more drawing for me.

492
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,166
What?

493
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:23,709
It'll cheer the Captain up.

494
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,055
He'll be over the moon.

495
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,977
He may even lean back
in his chair a little

496
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,131
and nod slightly.

497
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,348
This is a lot
of pressure.

498
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,264
If I'm gonna do this,
it has to be done right.

499
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,268
Scully, get me my oils.

500
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,440
Paint or massage?

501
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,040
I'll get both.

502
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,059
You know, this is one
of the most unhealthy people

503
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,083
I've ever seen.

504
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,044
It's like cutting

505
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,735
into a big,
overstuffed ravioli.

506
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:48,952
Sure you want me
to keep digging?

507
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,098
Unfortunately, yes.

508
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,052
If the primary on this case
says it's a murder,

509
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,237
we have to treat it
like a murder.

510
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,672
Okay.
Here we go.

511
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:57,633
Oh.

512
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,594
Wanna see
something cool?

513
00:15:58,595 --> 00:15:59,555
No.

514
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,516
Here it is.

515
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:01,631
That's what
I'm talking about.

516
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,328
[Gasps]
Listen.

517
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,706
Goosh.

518
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:06,956
Mm-hmm.

519
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:08,366
You know
what that was?

520
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,051
That was the air releasing from
the large intestine.

521
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,780
[Sighs]
In the biz, we call that

522
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,350
"the death bubble."
It's pretty cool.

523
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,208
- Here, you wanna hold it?
- No!

524
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:19,868
Knock knock.

525
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,149
You can knock
with your hands.

526
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,366
Saying it
is ridiculous.

527
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,191
Okay.

528
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,939
Well, I know
you're having a bad day...

529
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,596
I think
you're having a bad day.

530
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:35,016
So, to cheer you up
I had Terry do this painting

531
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,907
to replace
the photo you hated.

532
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:40,078
I threw away the photo because
I think it's ostentatious

533
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,488
to hang pictures
of yourself.

534
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,147
Especially when you haven't
earned a place on the wall.

535
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,454
- Oh.
- But you would have me

536
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:48,023
hang a baroque oil painting
of myself

537
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,582
like I'm
a north Korean dictator.

538
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,676
What?
No ornate gold frame?

539
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,360
Why am I not astride
my noble steed, clad in armor?

540
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,891
We could add a horse.

541
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,846
You just wasted your time,
Terry's time,

542
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:00,999
and now my time on this

543
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,088
when you should
have been filing a report

544
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,178
on the purse-snatcher.

545
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,395
Oh, I did.

546
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:05,434
It's already in the system.

547
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:06,862
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,752
Good.

549
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,635
Thank you.
Dismissed.

550
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,575
Here are the contents
of his stomach.

551
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,241
Oh, that's where
they went.

552
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,491
And here's
the really cool part.

553
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:20,939
Get in here, look at
the scarring on this liver.

554
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,296
Cause of death: Poison.

555
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,283
Ingested.

556
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:28,711
Boyle was right.

557
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:29,896
All right,
I'm gonna go tell him.

558
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:32,139
Yeah, you could.

559
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:34,958
Or you could
stay for a post-mortem.

560
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,720
Nope.
Sorry.

561
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,810
The spell has worn off.

562
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,924
No more weird dead guy sex
for me ever again.

563
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:40,949
It's nothing personal,

564
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,127
I just think sex
is for the living.

565
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,120
Isn't that right, buddy?

566
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,498
Oh, my God,
he has no eyes!

567
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,876
Oh, that is terrifying.

568
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,453
What now, Santiago?

569
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:56,280
I figured out
why you've been so tense.

570
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,457
You're worried about
the monthly crime statistics.

571
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,700
That's not your concern.

572
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,462
I just checked
the stats myself.

573
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:04,897
Our arrest numbers haven't
improved since you got here.

574
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,564
They're exactly the same
as last month.

575
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:08,135
If this is your strategy
to cheer me up,

576
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,159
it's backfiring.

577
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,537
Sir, I don't think
you realize

578
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,332
how good flat numbers are.

579
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,094
I went back 12 years.

580
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:16,049
A precinct's numbers
almost always get worse

581
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,099
under new leadership,
but ours didn't.

582
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,925
That's a win.

583
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:21,303
It's just your first month.

584
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,864
Morale is much higher,
people are working harder,

585
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:24,858
you're well on your way

586
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,364
to earning a place
on that wall.

587
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,695
Thank you, Santiago.

588
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,643
You know, we're birds
of a feather, you and I.

589
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,637
I hate cliches.

590
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,866
Cliches are the worst.
Okay.

591
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,861
We know you killed
your husband.

592
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,591
That cruise you planned
was for one,

593
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,738
plus the autopsy showed
clear signs of poison.

594
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,371
And for the record,
the inside of his body

595
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,293
- was very gross.
- Noted.

596
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:57,152
My only question is,
why'd you do it?

597
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,652
Um, he drove me to it.

598
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,093
He had affair after affair.

599
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:02,567
He was a real don Juan.

600
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,522
Permission to make a fat joke?
Granted.

601
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:05,867
Are you sure you didn't mean
"don flan"?

602
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:07,725
Thanks.
Nice.

603
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,719
Mrs. Patterson,
you are under arrest

604
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:12,338
for the murder
of your husband.

605
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:14,133
Sarge, that painting
is tight.

606
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,126
It's terrible.

607
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,792
The brushwork
is sloppy.

608
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,138
There's poor use
of negative space.

609
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,291
I'm a fraud.

610
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,374
Not at all.

611
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,423
I'd like to take this home
for my husband.

612
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,851
He'll be glad
you made me look so happy.

613
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,838
I was trying
to make him look serious.

614
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,959
I still can't read him.

615
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:32,586
- No one can.
- I can.

616
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:35,469
He likes it.

617
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:37,905
- (Diaz)
- Nice job, Boyle.

618
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,538
- You nailed it.
- Here.

619
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,525
Of course he did.
He's a great primary.

620
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,767
And I'm sorry
I was such a bad number two.

621
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,241
I may,
for the first time,

622
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:46,202
have been a bit of a jerk,

623
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:47,708
and I'm sorry.

624
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,278
What a wonderful moment.

625
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,392
I agree, it is
a wonderful moment.

626
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:52,545
What a wonderful moment.
Rosa, do you agree?

627
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,635
It's all right.
It's all right.

Oh.

00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,830
D.A. wants to set bail
for Patterson's wife.

632
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,400
They need me to send them
all the files.

633
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,074
I'm the secondary.

634
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,740
I'll go back there
and do the busy work.

635
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,502
You guys stay here
and keep celebrating.

You sure you're not
just sneaking off

Never.

1
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,083
Everyone, check your email.

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:06,372
The greatest thing that could
ever happen has just happened.

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,474
The girl who beat you for
high school valedictorian died?

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:11,176
No, "Kevin Cozner
requests your presence

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,178
At Raymond's birthday party."

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,680
Who's Kevin Cozner?

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,483
Is he the star
of "Danzes with Wolvez?"

8
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,085
He's captain Holt's husband.
Captain Raymond Holt.

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,420
We're invited
to the captain's birthday party.

10
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,689
Oh, the captain's party
and whatnot.

11
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,125
I can't wait to see the inside
of Raymond's house.

12
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,093
I'm gonna learn everything
there is to know about him.

13
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,797
I bet it's really fancy,
like beauty and the beast fancy.

14
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,133
No, it's probably just
an empty, white cube

15
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,634
With a usb port in it
for him to plug his finger in

16
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,369
When he's on sleep mode.

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,606
Apparently, my husband Kevin
has invited you all to my party.

18
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,307
There is very little
street parking, no gifts,

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,611
No singing of happy birthday.
Should be fun.

20
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,113
Sounds fantastic.

21
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:52,117
Did you hear that?
His husband invited us, not him.

22
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,118
He so doesn't want us there.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,520
Yes, he does.

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,356
Mm, it was kind of
a last-minute invite.

25
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,091
Just stirring the pot.

26
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,392
Why wouldn't Holt
want us there?

27
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,194
Because he thinks
we're going to embarrass him

28
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,330
In front of his husband,
which, frankly, is insulting!

29
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,199
Oh, man.

30
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,401
All the orange soda
spilled out of my cereal.

31
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,225
Happy birthday,
you sly, old fox.

32
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,860
How many spankings is it
this year?

33
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,396
Peralta, please.
Save some charm for the party.

34
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,798
Oh, you mean the party that you
begrudgingly invited us to

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,633
At the last minute
'cause you don't want us there?

36
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,202
I couldn't be happier
you're coming.

37
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,104
And it shows.
I can't wait to meet Kevin.

38
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,172
I assume he's the fun one
in the relationship.

39
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,508
I'm not sure you and Kevin
will get along.

40
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,443
Really?
Well, I disagree.

41
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,179
In fact, I will guarantee you
that by the end of the night,

42
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,215
Kev and I will be
best friends.

43
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,516
He hates being called "Kev."

44
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,219
Or does he?
Yes.

45
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,154
Bam!

46
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,623
Behold, my secret weapon
for winning over Kevin.

47
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,792
In this box
is every grisly crime

48
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,861
The nine-nine has worked
in the past eight years.

49
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,363
Civilians love
juicy cop stories.

50
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,198
Oh, I call that murder
where they strung

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,500
Fishing wire
through three guys.

52
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,135
Hey, we solved that
together.

53
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,836
Well, tough tetris.
I called it.

54
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,639
Also, I've loaded all of my
favorite karaoke backing tracks

55
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,307
Onto my phone.

56
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,510
Kevin and I will be duetting
rolling in the deep!

57
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,512
That's it,
emergency squad meeting,

58
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,347
Briefing room,
two minutes.

59
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,351
Uh, adult parties?

60
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,686
Sergeant, I believe
they're called orgies.

61
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,921
No-look five.

62
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,656
I met my wife at an orgy.

63
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,858
Well,
she was leaving an orgy,

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,927
And we bumped into each other
on the street.

65
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,629
Real meet-cute.

66
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,299
Thank you for exhibiting exactly
why this meeting is necessary.

67
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,934
Everyone here
needs some instruction

68
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,270
On interacting
with grown-ups.

69
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,671
Sergeant,
why am I here?

70
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,439
I'm always
incredibly appropriate.

71
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,808
In high school, I was voted
"most appropriate."

72
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,378
Ooh, self burn.
Those are rare.

73
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,880
I shouldn't be here either.
I'm fine at parties.

74
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,383
I just stand in the middle of
the room and don't say anything.

75
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,418
Here are the rules:
No staring at your phones,

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,220
No rolling in
two hours late.

77
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,290
No sweatpants, no jeans,
and no shorts.

78
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,658
What about dress-up shorts?

79
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,526
For instance, the kind
jen aniston might wear?

80
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,597
No, those are still shorts.
No shorts.

81
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,965
And everyone bring
a bottle of wine.

82
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,700
Why are there so many rules?
I mean, next thing

83
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,502
You're gonna say is
we can't be late.

84
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,404
Yeah, that's, like,
the first thing I said.

85
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,307
Ohh.

86
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,742
This neighborhood's amazing.

87
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,512
Class just seeps
outta every vestibule.

88
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,315
Keep it in your pants,
Santiago.

89
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,450
Scully, I specifically said,
"no shorts."

90
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,985
Sarge, it's not my fault.

91
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,554
You said so many things
about shorts, I got confused.

92
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,256
Man, did I screw the pooch.

93
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,257
Oh.
Peralta,

94
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,592
Where have you been?

95
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I know,

96
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:51,230
I am threety-five minutes late.
Yikes!

97
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,998
But I had to stop
and get some wine.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,002
Hello, good sir, I'd like your
finest bottle of wine, please.

99
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,605
That will be $1,600.

100
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,808
Great, I'd like your $8-est
bottle of wine, please.

101
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,978
It's from the finest vineyard
in arkansas.

102
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,848
Ah, samesies!

103
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,453
Wow.

104
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,421
Wow.

105
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,756
Ah, welcome.

106
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,757
Captain.

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,425
Raymond!

108
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,594
Those slacks
are a knockout.

109
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,929
Come on, amy.

110
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,597
I trust you found my home
easy to locate,

111
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,432
And thank you all for wearing
appropriate footwear.

112
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,301
Wow, you really
let your hair down

113
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,569
When you're not
at the office.

114
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,038
Ah, detectives,
meet my husband, Kevin.

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,473
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

116
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,675
Evening, so glad
you could make it.

117
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,745
Ah, and look,
he brought us some wine.

118
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,314
"drink." this is legally
called "wine drink."

119
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,616
Hmm, how very thoughtful.
Thank you.

120
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,918
It's red.
Like blood.

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,053
You know, I worked
a double homicide

122
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,454
On this block
a couple years ago.

123
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,323
The details
will astound you.

124
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,424
Yes, I am sorry.

125
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,592
Perhaps Raymond
didn't say anything.

126
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,627
Our home has
a "no shoptalk" policy.

127
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,962
I don't bring home beowulf,

128
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,297
And he doesn't bring home
cop stories.

129
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,532
Ah.
So may I pour you

130
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,901
Some of this wine drink
you brought us?

131
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,836
Perhaps all of it?

132
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,372
All of it sounds good.

133
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,975
Actually, ray and I met
over the phone.

134
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,410
Oh, they've all heard
the story.

135
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,312
No, we haven't,
and we need to.

136
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,480
Well, ray was a source
for an article I was writing

137
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,648
For The New Yorker.

138
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,350
I asked him a series
of dry questions

139
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,986
About police work, and
his answers had me in stitches.

140
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,321
There's no one funnier
than ray Holt.

141
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,822
Amen.
There isn't?

142
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,057
We met for a drink that night,

143
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,058
And we've been together
ever since.

144
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,693
Yeah.

145
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,761
So, Kevin, I hear you're
a professor at columbia?

146
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,663
That's right, yes.
I head the classics department.

147
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,598
Ah, interesting,
classics.

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,937
Zeppelin, Hendrix, Die Hard.
Total classics head over here.

149
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,107
I'm joking, obviously.
I know what the classics are.

150
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,410
The odyssey and...The one
you said when we got here,

151
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,346
The wolf one.

152
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,714
Kevin, why don't we go mingle

153
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,383
And let the detectives
settle in?

154
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,753
Boyle, what happened
to your shirt?

155
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,722
I spilled
a wonderful winter salsa.

156
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,757
Here, wear my shirt.
I was gonna take it off anyway.

157
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,125
Hitchcock, no!

158
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,361
Boyle, take my sweater.

159
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,565
Fits really well.
We have similar physiques.

160
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,966
We've been here
all of four minutes,

161
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,969
And you guys have already
forgotten everything I said!

162
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,038
Party huddle, stat!

163
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,774
Okay, gang,
we need a new strategy.

164
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,776
Totally.
What is going on out there?

165
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,112
We can't tell cop stories,
Kevin doesn't find me charming,

166
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,147
And a native english speaker
referred to captain Holt

167
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,750
As "hilarious."
I am flummoxed!

168
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,085
That's a word I learned
for this party, and I am it!

169
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,154
Well, I'm doing fine.
Really?

170
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,056
"Raymond, those slacks
are a knockout."

171
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,557
do you think he heard that?

172
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,592
Only 'cause you yelled it.

173
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,893
Shut up.

174
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,895
From now on,
we play to our strengths.

175
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,764
Charles, you know everything
about food.

176
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,098
That's all you talk about.

177
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,135
Will ever know everything
about food.

178
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,603
It's an evolving discipline.

179
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,004
That's great stuff.

180
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,073
It's so boring.
Don't waste it.

181
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,741
Amy, you studied art history.

182
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,942
That's interesting.

183
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,744
Scully, opera.

184
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,981
Hitchcock, nothing.
Talk about nothing.

185
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,083
Rosa, stick with Gina.

186
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,851
Make sure she doesn't say
anything insane

187
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,852
Or steal anything.

188
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,721
Too late.

189
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,690
Don't worry, it's just, like,
hats and scarves and stuff.

190
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,993
She will put those back.
I will handle the chitchat.

191
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,561
Well, that just leaves you,
Peralta.

192
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,730
What's your cultural specialty?

193
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,131
Easy, Kevin mentioned
The New Yorker,

194
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,066
And I've totally
read that.

195
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,707
Keep a low profile,
chuckle at anecdotes.

196
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,209
Try not to start
any conversations.

197
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,877
Got it.

198
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,146
Wait a minute,
you're Hitchcocking me?

199
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,549
Well, not surprising.
We're practically twins.

200
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,485
"be appropriate," on three.
Quietly.

201
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,487
One, two, three.

202
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,989
Be appropriate.

203
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,691
Now, break it up.
We look weird.

204
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,860
Okay.

205
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,033
Don't move as a group.
You're not gazelles.

206
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,907
No, no,
I said, "millimeters."

207
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,646
Oh, Ray, I'm gonna choke
from laughter.

208
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,814
You're too funny!

209
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,752
Yes, great humor words,
Raymond.

210
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,821
You know, it reminds me
of a very interesting article

211
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,857
I read about human trafficking
in The New Yorker.

212
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,024
No, it doesn't.
Oh.

213
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,726
The one written
by David Remnick.

214
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,595
I loved that piece,
from four weeks ago.

215
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,130
Or was it three weeks?
No, four.

216
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,533
Anyways, I was riveted.

217
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,702
I'm a huge New Yorker guy.

218
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,670
I could talk
about that article for hours.

219
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,838
Great.
That's unnecessary.

220
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,839
Let's do that right now.

221
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,574
Let's do.

222
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,010
Ah, there they are.
Kevin, let's greet our guests.

223
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,246
Oh. Mm-hmm.
Duty calls.

224
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,948
To be continued.

225
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,918
Totes!
Can't wait!

226
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,653
I can wait.

227
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,121
All I remember
about that article is the title.

228
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,956
I was hopped up
on nitrous.

229
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,658
Well, we gotta find
that magazine.

230
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,826
It's gotta be in here
somewhere, right?

231
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,128
This place is like
a candy store for nerds.

232
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,698
Stop eating crab wrong!

233
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,970
Ah, pepper relish
on your arancini.

234
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,972
Very playful.
Cut through the richness,

235
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,974
Add a little levity.
I love that.

236
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,809
You really know your food.

237
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,844
Well, you could say
it's the only thing

238
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,045
I'm allowed to talk about.

239
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,581
I'm Charles.
I work with captain Holt.

240
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,584
I'm vivian ludley.
I work with Kevin.

241
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,753
No.
The vivian ludley?

242
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,821
Author of stone fruits
and stone-stones:

243
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,891
Food of the paleolithic era?
I'm a huge fan!

244
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,193
It's got the best recipes
for making salads out of moss.

245
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:26,598
The trick is, you have
to lean into the dirt taste.

246
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Aha.
Mm-hmm.

247
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:33,204
Chickpeas, tahini,
smoked paprika...

248
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,040
They make their own hummus.

249
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,741
Santiago?

250
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,742
Sergeant!

251
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,311
I'm learning so much.

252
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,581
We both have blue hand towels,
we have the same microwave,

253
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,216
And once I buy coasters
made out of geodes,

254
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,217
We'll both have those.

255
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,953
Yeah.

256
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,322
No, hey!
My notes!

257
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,124
This is a birthday party,
not a recon mission.

258
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,261
You can get this back
at the end of the night.

259
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,929
All right.

260
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,897
Let's go interact
with these dummies.

261
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,298
Wait here.

262
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,802
What do you teach?

263
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,970
Comparative historiography

264
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,771
Of the French
and American revolutions.

265
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,206
Nope.
How 'bout you?

266
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,908
Molecular biology.

267
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,810
Worse.
What do you study?

268
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,612
Abnormal psychology.

269
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,381
So, like,
weirdos and freaks.

270
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,849
You should meet my friend.

271
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,652
Hey.

272
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,387
Gina, what are you
thinking about right now?

273
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,625
I was thinking how I would make
the perfect american president,

274
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:31,296
Based upon my skill set,
dance ability, and bloodlust.

275
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,766
That is fascinating.

276
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,036
"ah-shan-ti."

277
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,945
Oh, man, it's black Tom Selleck
and white Sidney Poitier.

278
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,914
Come on.

279
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,683
All books and no magazines?

280
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,786
What kind of crappy library's
full of books?

281
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,921
A crap library.

282
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,657
All of the magazines
are in the bathroom.

283
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,225
Great solve, Peralta.

284
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,292
Ah!

285
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,694
Can I help you?

286
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:03,962
Captain.

287
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,031
I didn't hear you
silently sneak up on me.

288
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,900
Oh, that reminds me, tell Kevin
that I am available for brunch

289
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,901
On Sunday the 17th.

290
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,870
The 17th is a Tuesday.

291
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,906
Why are you talking about
The New Yorker all of a sudden?

292
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,675
I always talk
about smart stuff.

293
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,310
You know, the jazz age,
what's in a name,

294
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,781
The 1950s movies
that are from the '50s.

295
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,884
Those were the categories
on Jeopardy last night.

296
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,352
Don't try so hard
to impress my husband.

297
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,421
Yes, sir.

298
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,958
To the crap library.

299
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,862
April 13th, May 2nd...

300
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,799
Come on! Why doesn't my life
always work out perfectly?

301
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,303
Uh, just a second!
I'm halfway done!

302
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,839
I'm halfway there,
I'm halfway done...

303
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,142
With what's happening
in here.
Okay.

304
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:56,047
♪ una furtiva lagrima ♪

305
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,982
This song gets to me
every time.

306
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,452
It's beautiful.
You must be so proud.

307
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,820
I sure am.

308
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,388
How long have you two
been together?

309
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,356
We've been partners
for almost 30 years.

310
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,026
So do you two ever
get harassed at work?

311
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,061
Harassed?
For what?

312
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,198
For being a gay couple
who works together in the nypd.

313
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,035
Bu-u-u-ooh...

314
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,904
Peralta.
Hey, don't you one-minute me.

315
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,040
I will break that finger off.
Hang up that phone.

316
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,875
I'm talking
to my credit card company.

317
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,810
I tried to get an online
subscription to The New Yorker,

318
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,112
And they declined me.

319
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,047
Apparently,
based on my previous purchases,

320
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,415
They assumed it was fraud.

321
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,217
That's crazy.
I'm fancy.

322
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,919
One time, I had
coffee-flavored ice cream.

323
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,087
Shut up!
Okay.

324
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,989
Hang up now.

325
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,991
If you're that desperate,
the first two paragraphs

326
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,459
Of the article
are on the free site.

327
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,261
Hmm.
You have one minute
to look it up,

328
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,898
And then if I catch you
on that phone again...

329
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,867
Oh, my.
Don't worry.

330
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,403
I'm due for an upgrade,
and my babies are on the cloud.

331
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,007
He is so strong.

332
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,377
Ah, thank you.

333
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,879
Lovely party, Kevin.

334
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,548
These tiny pickles
are hilarious.

335
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,252
They're called cornichon.

336
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,487
So that New Yorker article
about human trafficking

337
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,156
We were discussing--
yes, so interesting,

338
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,458
Especially
the first two paragraphs.

339
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,293
Right, but what did you think
of the thesis,

340
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,429
Vis-a-vis modern slavery and its
undeniable role in the economy?

341
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,398
Good.

342
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,001
If you ask me, the whole thesis
was way off base,

343
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,803
Vis-a-vis
the rest of the article

344
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,339
Vis-a-vis...America.

345
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,242
The article
was antislavery.

346
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,044
Are you saying
that slavery is good?

347
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,479
You know, I think you're missing
the point of the article.

348
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,980
You must not be
remembering it right.

349
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,949
Well, I just read it
last night as I got in bed.

350
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:38,950
It's quite fresh
in my memory.

351
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,819
Ah.
You know,

352
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,554
I would like to hear
more of your thoughts.

353
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,355
And I would love
to give them to you,

354
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,591
But unfortunately, I have
got to hit the crap library.

355
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,394
Excuse me one second.

356
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,896
My last meal on earth?
Mm.

357
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,298
That's a great question.

358
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,568
I'd go classic french.
Ortolan.

359
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,304
Tiny songbird,
eaten in a single bite,

360
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,840
Bones and all
in open defiance of god.

361
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,608
It's illegal
to consume ortolan,

362
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,212
But I actually got academic
dispensation to eat one once.

363
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,514
Ohh.
The beak, very crunchy.

364
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,484
That is literally the sexiest
thing anyone has ever said.

365
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,953
How are you single?

366
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,389
You're not seeing anyone?

367
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,928
No.
There is nobody in my life.

368
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,867
Sort of a sad thing
to wink about, I realize now.

369
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,535
Aren't you supposed to be
babysitting Gina?

370
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,370
Doesn't need my help.

371
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,572
She's over there,
dazzling some psychologists.

372
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,175
All men are at least 30%
attracted to me.

373
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,210
My mother cried
the day I was born,

374
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,313
Because she knew she would
never be better than me.

375
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,616
At any given moment,
I'm thinking about one thing:

376
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:48,186
Richard dreyfuss hunkered over
eating dog food.

377
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,122
I feel like
I'm the paris of people.

378
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,558
Complete overlap of ego and id.

379
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,926
It's been theorized,

380
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,661
But I never thought
I'd see it.

381
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,962
I'm exquisite.

382
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,037
I can't believe
I'm frenching in the closet.

383
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,605
I feel like a teenager!

384
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,540
I feel like I'm 40 again.

385
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,575
Chew on this shiso leaf.

386
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,543
It'll give our kissing

387
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,445
Umami flavor.

388
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,154
Delicious.

389
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,492
Time to put my newfound
knowledge to the test.

390
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:31,663
So, sir, popcorn setting,
always too short, am I right?

391
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,398
I'm sorry?

392
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,067
On our microwave.
We have the same microwave.

393
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,537
Oh, I didn't buy it.
It came with the house.

394
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,440
Hummus.
Thoughts?

395
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,677
I have no thoughts
about hummus.

396
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,445
If you'll excuse me.

397
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,314
Yeah.

398
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,351
Blink twice if you'd like me
to mercy kill you.

399
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,619
I thought I had done
enough recon,

400
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,455
But clearly, I have only
scratched the surface.

401
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,958
If I'm gonna bond with him,

402
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,493
I have to massively violate
his privacy.

403
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,429
But truffaut
wrote breathless,

404
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,965
And I've always considered
movies a writer's medium.

405
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,134
I can't agree.
It's godard's film.

406
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,502
Come on!

407
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,538
I mean, truffaut
is also important.

408
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,641
Seriously?
Hold this, I gotta go.

409
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,279
Wow.
Maybe it is truffaut's film.

410
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,315
Mighty dvr, tell me
the captain's secrets.

411
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,117
Unveil yourself to me.

412
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,753
Ooh, how it's made:
Contact lenses.

413
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,222
Bingo!

414
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,458
What are you doing here?

415
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,693
I--what? I'm not.
What are you doing here?

416
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,595
I need to find a New Yorker
that Kevin left by the bed,

417
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,365
So I can justify
this whole proslavery stance

418
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,499
I've backed myself into.

419
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,302
Detectives!

420
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,670
Sarge! I see that you,

421
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,040
Like I, came up here
to chastise Santiago.

422
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,209
Amy, this is low,
even for you.

423
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,012
I cannot believe
you would both violate

424
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,413
The "please stay downstairs"
rule,

425
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,015
Which was prominently posted!

426
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,217
Get outta here!

427
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,352
I don't know why we have to
have this discussion again.

428
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,353
What do we do?

429
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,455
Bathroom! Bathroom.

430
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,659
Why are you upset with me?

431
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,461
Your employees are the ones
putting a damper on the party.

432
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,196
They are acting terribly.

433
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,564
You're the one who's been
acting terribly tonight.

434
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,666
You've been curt and snobby
with my guests.

435
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,535
You've been needling
poor Peralta so much,

436
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,237
You've practically
made him a new suit.

437
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,571
Needled him a new suit.

438
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,306
Even when we're fighting,
you're hilarious.

439
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,142
Stop it.
Stop it.

440
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,378
Oh, no!
Dog, allergies, sneezing.

441
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,479
No! Get away!

442
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,480
Shh.

443
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,416
Grab the dog!

444
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,587
Look at me.

445
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,590
Do not blow this for us.

446
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,225
You know what, I knew
this wasn't going to work.

447
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,094
It never has.
We should've just gone out

448
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,495
For dinner to a restaurant,
like we do every year.

449
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,297
Why did you make me
invite them?

450
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,332
I made you invite them
because I like them.

451
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,600
They're good people.

452
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,573
Santiago, are you hiding
in my bathroom

453
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,509
With a dog that
you're deathly allergic to?

454
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,844
No.

455
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,551
Occupied?

456
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,190
Well, this has been
a stinky 12 hours.

457
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,825
My computer bag got a hole
in the bottom,

458
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,460
And my power cord
fell out.

459
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,628
Last night
was such a disaster.

460
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,764
I wheeze-cried myself
to sleep.

461
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,632
Well, at least captain
said he liked us,

462
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,334
Right before he kicked us
out of his house

463
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,569
For violating his trust.

464
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,471
Why didn't Kevin
want to invite us?

465
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,639
We could have been
really cool people.

466
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,842
We weren't,
but we could've been.

467
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,277
Well, as soon as he unveiled
his "no cop talk" policy,

468
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,712
I was sunk.

469
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,681
Gruesome murders are
the cornerstone of my charm.

470
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,549
Well, he spent the last 30 years
with a cop.

471
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,685
Maybe he's sick
of hearing about it.

472
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,587
Wait.

473
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,289
Maybe that's not
what he's sick of.

474
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,259
Santiago, you brilliant bastard,
you figured it out!

475
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,765
Hello again,
professor Kevin Cozner.

476
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,467
What do you want?

477
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,203
I'd like to tell you
about a case I solved.

478
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,705
Thank you,
but just as with my home,

479
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,707
My office has a strict
"no cop talk" policy.

480
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,542
I figured, but the case
that I have solved

481
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,744
Is the case
of the "no cop talk" policy.

482
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,714
There were three things that
bothered me about last night:

483
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,616
You didn't want the nine-nine
at your party,

484
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,417
Even though
you'd never met us,

485
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,852
Your friends immediately
asked Hitchcock and Scully

486
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,554
If they were harassed,

487
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,788
And there was
something interesting

488
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,790
About that photo
in your library--

489
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,226
You and the captain
were shunted off to the side.

490
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,728
I don't think
you dislike cop talk.

491
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,563
I think you dislike cops.

492
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,331
I'm married to one.

493
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,233
I know, and I can't imagine
it's been fun

494
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,802
Watching the man you love
marGinalized, underappreciated,

495
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,738
And disrespected
by the nypd.

496
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,706
Because he's gay, Raymond
has been put through hell

497
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,475
By his colleagues,
many of whom,

498
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,377
Quite frankly,
look exactly like you.

499
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,213
Devastatingly handsome?

500
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,681
I'm sorry,
I'm uncomfortable with emotions.

501
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,750
So yes, I decided
a long time ago

502
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,552
That just because
I love Raymond

503
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,454
Doesn't mean I have to love
the people he works with.

504
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,756
Good solve, detective.

505
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,457
Nice cop lingo.

506
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,794
Look, I'm really sorry
that we ruined your party.

507
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,596
I'd like to make it up
to you.

508
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,898
Captain, thank you
for joining us.

509
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,333
What's going on?

510
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,701
A proper birthday dinner.

511
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,303
Amy chose the restaurant.

512
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,804
Captain.

513
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,574
Ah, perfect.
I've always wanted to come here.

514
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,875
Boyle picked the menu.

515
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,677
Vivian helped.

516
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,879
Terry chose the champagne.

517
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,281
I'm sorry
about your party, sir.

518
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,784
I tried to keep them in line,
but I failed.

519
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,552
Well, that's not your job.
I'm only sorry

520
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,787
You didn't get a chance
to enjoy yourself.

521
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,289
Gina has brought back
all the silverware

522
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,958
That she stole
from your house.

523
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,862
What?
Also, this clock.

524
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,863
Good heavens.

525
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,465
This isn't ours.

526
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,400
And my contribution
will be to refrain

527
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,804
From discussing The New Yorker
for the rest of my living days.

528
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,006
Enjoy.
Thank you, jake.

529
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,774
You're welcome, Kevin.
Call me "Kev."

530
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,643
Oh.
What?

531
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,311
Oh, he told you to say that,
didn't he?

532
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,480
Well, you are always playing
pranks on me, Raymond.

533
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,681
Just once, let me
be the funny one.

534
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,784
And finally,
it is my great pleasure

535
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,754
To introduce the nine-nine zone
detective Scully

536
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,789
To serenade you.

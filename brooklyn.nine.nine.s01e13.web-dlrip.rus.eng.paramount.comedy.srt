1
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:04,327
Charles, this is exciting.

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:06,666
- Medal of valor.
- I know.

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:07,724
For getting shot
in the butt.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,694
Oh, my butt!

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,136
For exceptional acts
of heroism

6
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:15,963
or voluntary risk
of personal safety.

7
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,534
But, you know, six of one.

8
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,907
This is one of
the NYPD's highest honors.

9
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:23,624
Today is your day,
Detective Boyle.

10
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,741
Heroism can't be
measured by a piece of metal.

11
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:26,894
But what else can we do

12
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,850
to recognize
the brave officers

13
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,741
that have put their
lives on the line?

14
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:33,724
It is my great honor to present
the medal of valor

15
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:37,410
to Detective
Charles Boyle...

16
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:39,623
And sergeant
peanut butter.

17
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,239
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,779
Charles is getting
the same medal as a horse.

19
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:52,830
At least Boyle
was announced first.

20
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,400
Because the horse
outranks him.

21
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,554
This is amazing.

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,222
That's enough, Peralta.

23
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,408
<i>This is a huge honor,</i>

24
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,787
<i>and nothing can take that
away from him.</i>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,710
The horse is pooping
on the stage.

26
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,601
Sergeant peanut butter
is pooping on the stage.

28
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:27,645
Peralta.

29
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:28,733
Santiago.

30
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,729
The bet ends today.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,364
Are you ready?
I was born ready.

32
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,614
To lose?
The whole question was,

33
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:33,575
"are you ready to lose?"

34
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:34,825
And you said
you were born that way.

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:35,980
Twist my words
all you want.

36
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,423
Okay.
I'm winning this bet.

37
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:38,512
- No.
-  <i>What bet?</i>

38
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>What are you guys
talking about?</i>

39
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,981
Seriously?
The bet?

40
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,360
They've been keeping score
all year.

41
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,321
It comes up
all the time.

42
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,956
What are you doing
all day?

43
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,784
Nothing.
Why, you wanna hang out?

44
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,643
<i>A year ago today,
Peralta and I made a bet</i>

45
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,246
to prove who's
a better Detective.

46
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:52,618
Whoever makes more
felony arrests, wins.

47
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,933
What are the stakes?

48
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,625
And don't say money,
because I know you're in debt.

49
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,516
If you really knew
anything about me,

50
00:01:58,517 --> 00:01:59,863
you would've said
"crushing debt,"

51
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:01,049
and I'll bet whatever,

52
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,236
'cause there's no way
I'm losing.

53
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,383
What about your car?
Oh!

54
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,730
That thing
is a date magnet.

55
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,038
I mean, how many girls have you
made out with in that car?

56
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,602
Six?
Well, I'm gonna win, so sure.

57
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:12,558
Let's bet the car.

58
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,681
Yes.

59
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,675
<i>No, Jakey, no!</i>

60
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,020
<i>That car
is your superpower.</i>

61
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,880
Thor would never
wager his hammer.

62
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,349
Neil Patrick Harris would never
wager his showmanship.

63
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,471
Losing that car will be
the worst thing

64
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:22,496
in the world for you.

65
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:23,457
Well, what's
the worst thing

66
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,996
in the world for you,
Santiago?

67
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,793
Being one of those girls
in Jake's car.

68
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:28,074
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

69
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:29,485
Then it is settled.

70
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:32,274
If Peralta loses,
Santiago gets his car.

71
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:35,511
If Santiago loses, she goes
for a date in said car.

72
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,506
Game on.

73
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:37,852
Game on.

74
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:39,680
Wow, your handshake
is quite firm.

75
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:40,672
I took a seminar.

76
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,668
Where?

77
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,269
And the score
is all tied up.

78
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,969
But not for long.

79
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,086
For in eight hours,
I will win the bet

80
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,688
and take Santiago
on the worst date

81
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:50,066
in the history
of the world.

82
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,183
<i>Attention.</i>

83
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,176
After today's shift,
I'd like everyone

84
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,523
join me at the bar
for drinks

85
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,535
in honor of Detective Boyle
and his medal of valor.

86
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,460
Oh, my God, is peanut butter
gonna be there?

87
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,479
That horse is a damn hero.

88
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,082
Peanut butter
will not be joining us.

89
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,615
He's being feted
by the united nations.

90
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,954
<i>As you were.</i>

91
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,070
Pen.
You... ow!

92
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:11,289
Rolly chair!

93
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,019
Gina's desk!
Oh, Jake.

94
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,943
No!

95
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,182
Captain, hey.

96
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:19,816
<i>You're looking
stoic today,</i>

97
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,220
like a wise old oak.

98
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,792
I'm not gonna give you
more cases

99
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:25,876
so you can win your bet
with Santiago.

100
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,478
What?
Oh, right, the bet.

101
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,562
Totally forgot
about that.

102
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,133
Well, granted,
this friendly competition

103
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,313
has led to you and Santiago
putting in more hours

104
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:36,102
and arresting more perps,
especially this last week.

105
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:39,051
Up by one, Peralta.

106
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,237
Anything you want to say
to your car

107
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,673
before you never
see it again? Hmm?

108
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,719
Hey, Santiago, do you have
any dietary restrictions

109
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,289
that medieval times
should know about?

110
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,669
Yes, 3-1-1?

111
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,010
What's the safest way
to set a car on fire?

112
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,221
Ooh. Hmm!

113
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,402
Both of you have done
exemplary work,

114
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,588
which I appreciate.

115
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,735
And I can see that by
the absolutely no indicators

116
00:03:58,736 --> 00:03:59,695
on your face.

117
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,236
However,
you are colleagues,

118
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:03,064
and the fallout from this bet
has the potential

119
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,244
to put a strain on your
professional relationship.

120
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,685
Only if I lose.

121
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:07,873
I'm a terrible sport.

122
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:09,667
Cases will be assigned
as they usually are.

123
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>Dismissed.</i>

124
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,675
Captain, you look...
No.

125
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,157
Rosa, hey,
would you like to share

126
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:25,311
a cup of coffee with me?

127
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,363
<i>I got some gorgeous
new coffee beans.</i>

128
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:28,678
Sure,
that sounds great.

129
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,633
Isn't that, like, your fifth
cup of coffee today?

130
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,915
I'm trying
to counteract

131
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,871
the drowsiness
from my pain meds.

132
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:34,961
I took
a double dose

133
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,012
after the incident
at the ceremony.

134
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:40,283
Bring peanut
butter forward... forward.

135
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:42,815
Uh, can the little guy
take a big step back, please?

136
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,161
My name
is Charles Boyle.

137
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:46,342
I won the same medal
as this horse.

138
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:49,932
The footage from my fall
led the local news,

139
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,952
so who's the hero now,
peanut butter?

140
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:53,747
Peanut butter.

141
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:56,022
Gina, you're just
trying to hurt me

142
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:58,492
to distract yourself
from your own internal pain.

143
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:01,248
Also, you should use
less conditioner,

144
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,133
because this
is a flat mess.

145
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,345
<i>What's going on with Boyle?</i>

146
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,820
His pain meds
are making him weird.

147
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,931
Oh, okay.
Yes.

148
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:11,989
This happened to my dad

149
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,232
when he got
his vasectomy un-reversed.

150
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,604
You get all relaxed
and you have no filter

151
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:18,945
and you just start dropping
truth bombs on everyone.

152
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,765
Oh, that explains
the elevator.

153
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:24,138
I'm worried you don't
find me interesting.

154
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:26,606
I'm gonna pretend
someone texted me.

155
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,396
Bloop.

156
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,082
Gina, please keep an eye
on Boyle today.

157
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,589
He's gonna say something
to the wrong person

158
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,710
and get himself punched.

159
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,251
Sure, I'd love to see
Charles get punched.

160
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,404
Try again?

161
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,840
I will stop Charles
from getting punched.

162
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,834
Correct.

163
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:44,367
Great.

164
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,354
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

165
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,433
I present Carl Laudson,
who stole $3,000.

166
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,869
Santiago takes the lead
with one minute left.

167
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,343
Suck it, Peralta.

168
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,337
Oh, no.

169
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,908
That's right,
"oh, no."

170
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,255
Oh, no.
You don't seem worried.

171
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,216
Why aren't you worried?

172
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,075
Bring in the Johns.

173
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,743
I ran a prostitution sting
through vice

174
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,697
and arrested 30 guys
for soliciting.

175
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,820
That's not a felony.

176
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,133
It is when
it's your second offense,

177
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:08,571
which is the case for ten
of these gentlemen.

178
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:11,648
Four of them
are actually named John.

179
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:12,738
Ironic.

180
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,278
Anyhoo,
ten more for Peralta.

181
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,239
Accept your fate.

182
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,264
Never.

183
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:21,105
Five, four, three, two, one.
No.

184
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:24,088
Jake wins,
Amy loses.

185
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,511
♪ Celebrate
good times come on! ♪

186
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,210
♪ Let's celebrate

187
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,069
Look!

188
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,462
♪ Celebrate good times, come on!
♪ Whoo!

189
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,962
Amy Santiago,
you have made me

190
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,661
the happiest man
on earth.

191
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,745
I spent $1
on this ring.

192
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,828
Will you go on the worst date
ever with me?

193
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,176
You have to say yes.

194
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,329
Yes.

195
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,285
She said yes!

196
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,695
She said yes.

197
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,613
This is for you.

198
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,987
Amy Santiago,
date time.

199
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,359
Time to date.

200
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,763
Peralta, this outfit
is ridiculous.

201
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:05,886
Chop chop.

202
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:06,847
There's plenty
of embarrassing to do

203
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:10,629
and only a few hours
to do it in.

204
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,784
Happy?

205
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,130
Oh, yeah.

206
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,117
You look like every girl
at every bat mitzvah

207
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:16,336
I ever had a crush on.

208
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,421
Let's see the bow.

209
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:20,247
Just like
Jenny Gildenhorn.

210
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,594
Why do I wish
you had braces?

211
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,004
Should we get you braces?

212
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:23,965
No, that's too much.

213
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,075
Here I come.

214
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:28,037
Nice shorts.

215
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:28,999
Thank you.
Believe it or not,

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,216
they were not
very expensive.

217
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,917
Do I really have to
wear this all night?

218
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,910
You know the rules.

219
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,289
The date starts now
and ends at midnight.

220
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,282
I decide what you wear,

221
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:36,596
what you eat,
and where we go.

222
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,219
Oh, and there is
one more rule.

223
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,495
No matter
what happens,

224
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,483
you're not allowed
to fall in love with me.

225
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:47,400
Won't be a problem.

226
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,620
Detective Boyle, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

227
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,923
Your medal
was well-deserved.

228
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,121
Thank you, sir.

229
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,467
Your breath is terrible.

230
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,455
Charles,
can I speak with you?

231
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,249
Hey, where's Rosa?

232
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,821
I haven't seen her
all night.

233
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:04,327
Did you know my wife
pays me alimony?

234
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:06,379
Okay, let's take a seat.

235
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,110
I'm gonna keep an eye on
you all night, little buddy.

236
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,265
Okay.
Thanks.

237
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,227
Hey, baby.

238
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,951
Hey, baby.
Happy you made it.

239
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,388
Captain, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Sharon.

240
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:16,446
It's so wonderful
to meet you.

241
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:17,760
I've heard such great things
about you.

242
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,721
And you.

243
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,420
Your husband
is a real hero.

244
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,735
If you ask me,
he should've been up there

245
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:22,826
with Detective Boyle today.

246
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:23,883
What for?

247
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,659
For saving my life.

248
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,179
He means metaphorically.

249
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,941
You know, saving him
from all that paperwork.

250
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,071
Paper cuts
are a slow death, baby.

251
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,918
No, I was referring to how
he threw his body

252
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,360
at an emotionally
disturbed criminal

253
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,513
who was trying
to kill me.

254
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,437
Nooo!

255
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,958
He did what?

256
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,056
Are you
back in the field?

257
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,119
Oh.
I have caused a problem.

258
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,965
I think I am...

259
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,537
Getting a text message.

260
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:54,754
Bloop.

261
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:58,121
Ah. There it is.

262
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,641
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

263
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,647
I thought I told you.

264
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,346
Remember when you were
half asleep

265
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:05,013
watching the news
and the babies were quiet,

266
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,809
and I said, real low,
"hey, baby.

267
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,092
I'm back in the field.
You want something to eat?"

268
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,116
And you were like,
"what?"

269
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,271
And I was like,
"you want something to eat?"

270
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:11,488
And you said, "sure."

271
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:14,027
And I got you
an oatmeal cookie?

272
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,272
Remember?

273
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:18,028
You are a piece of work,
Terrance.

274
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh, damn.
She called me Terrance.

275
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,511
I'm doomed.

276
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,159
<i>Hot date coming through.</i>

277
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,531
Hey, attention,
everyone.

278
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:34,282
Now I know that tonight
is Boyle's big night.

279
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:39,573
But let's forget about that
completely for a moment

280
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,719
and admire and comment on every
terrible aspect of this.

281
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:46,646
Permission to go
to the bathroom?

282
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,132
Granted.
First of three.

283
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,216
Use them wisely.

284
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,299
Hey.

285
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,389
Congrats again, buddy.

286
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,928
I really am proud of you.

287
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,371
Still wearing the medal,
huh?

288
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:58,134
Yes, I want women to be
impressed by me.

289
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,282
All right.

290
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,916
Well, I'm sorry
that I can't stay,

291
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,258
but I have a terrible night
planned for Amy.

292
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,372
First up is the mall
photo studio,

293
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,200
where we'll take our official
date portrait.

294
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,740
The picture will
be the two of us

295
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,373
playing one saxophone.

296
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,586
Then some peel-and-eat shrimp
for dinner

297
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:15,958
at a dangerously cheap
seafood restaurant.

298
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,010
And then I've contracted
a youth choir

299
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,164
to serenade us.

300
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:23,427
♪ Santiago Santiago

301
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:24,550
<i>♪ Santiago</i>

302
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,543
♪ Santiago ♪

303
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:28,044
♪ You suck so bad

304
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,103
Yes!

305
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,673
They'll sing to her
at midnight

306
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,052
the middle
of Times Square.

307
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,199
She and
500 German tourists

308
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,026
will savor that memory
for all times.

309
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,501
Jake, do you know why
little boys

310
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,360
pull little girls' pigtails
on playgrounds?

311
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:40,450
'Cause they're so easy
to grab.

312
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,797
They're just begging
to be pulled.

313
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,015
Because they
like the girls,

314
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:43,977
and that's the only way
they know

315
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:44,907
how to get
their attention.

316
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:46,446
What are you saying?

317
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,690
All of this teasing,
this elaborate date,

318
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,548
somewhere down deep,
you like Amy.

319
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,735
Like, "like her,"
like her.

320
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,660
Okay, that's
straight-up insanity.

321
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:54,973
How much did you spend
on tonight?

322
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:57,474
$1,400, but all of it's
on credit cards,

323
00:10:57,475 --> 00:10:59,557
so it's, like, $5 a month
for the next 2,000 years.

324
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:00,616
I do not like Amy!

325
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,379
You're putting a lot
of effort into a joke.

326
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,436
Why don't you sit down

327
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:04,398
and have a real
conversation with her?

328
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,872
Okay, Boyle,

329
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,470
you live in your ex-wife's
new boyfriend's basement.

330
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,912
I'm not taking advice
from you.

331
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,035
Hup.

332
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:14,689
I'm ashamed
of my living situation.

333
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,965
Rosa, why are you
sequestered

334
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:18,632
over by this
old cell phone?

335
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,491
I'm avoiding Boyle
and his truth bombs.

336
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:24,818
I sometimes worry
I'm gonna become you.

337
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,263
He keeps saying
he wants to talk to me.

338
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:27,608
I'm afraid he's gonna
tell me he loves me

339
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,500
or propose marriage
or something.

340
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:30,588
Oh, my God.

341
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,289
That makes me kind of
want to cry.

342
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,725
He dove in front
of those bullets for me.

343
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,911
I can't be mean to him.

344
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,963
I watched him
make coffee

345
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,695
for 28 minutes
this morning.

346
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,073
But I also can't
lead him on.

347
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,285
Captain Holt told me not to
let him get hurt tonight.

348
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,171
So I'll keep him
away from you.

349
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,087
Have you seen Rosa?

350
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,851
Rosa died
eight years ago.

351
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,832
Come on.
Let's get you a drink.

352
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,337
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

353
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,353
Santiago and I will be
performing the steerage jig

354
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,762
from the film <i>Titanic,</i>

355
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,269
<i>which we have prepared for</i>

356
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,807
in no way, shape,
or form.

357
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,802
Romantic.

358
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,052
No, embarrassing.

359
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,495
Milady.

360
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,188
You look pretty.
I hate your guts.

361
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:16,369
Channel that passion
into the dance.

362
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,324
Peralta.
Scully, tag in.

363
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:20,376
Okay.
Keep spinning.

364
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,396
Yes. One of
our informants just called.

365
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:23,358
We've been tracking
a crew

366
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,628
that lifts cargo
out of Laguardia.

367
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,211
The C.I. knows
where the trucks unload,

368
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,750
so I need you to stake out
the drop site.

369
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:30,121
Oh, sir,
I'm right in the middle

370
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:32,045
of this date
and I cannot reschedule.

371
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,641
I have far, far too many
non-refundable deposits.

372
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:36,790
I'm renting a tiger cub
by the hour.

373
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,297
For what?
Don't even know.

374
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:39,354
Waiting for inspiration.

375
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,759
Well, this is not
a negotiation, so go.

376
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,676
All right, fine,
but I'm taking Santiago with me.

377
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,016
As soon as we're done,
it's back to the date.

378
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,524
Darling.

379
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,741
Brief pause.
Duty calls.

380
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:52,979
Oh, thank God.

381
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,165
Gina, tag in?

382
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,410
No, not even
if it would cure cancer.

383
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,326
Okay.

384
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,617
Look, baby, I'm sorry,

385
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,086
but Captain's life
was in danger.

386
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,170
I just did
what I had to do.

387
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,189
It was
an impulse decision.

388
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,235
Well, I guess
I can understand that.

389
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,870
<i>Sharon.</i>

390
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:16,928
I have to apologize.

391
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,722
I want to assure you
that the call

392
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,006
to put sergeant Jeffords
back in the field

393
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,372
wasn't a spur-of-the-moment,
impulse decision.

394
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,872
It's been in the works
for a few months now.

395
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,398
Terry said
it just happened.

396
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,561
I think you two need to get
your stories straight.

397
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,894
Perhaps I should
stop talking to your wife.

398
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,138
That's a good call.
Captain.

399
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,998
Sharon.

400
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:44,497
<i>I'm so happy</i>

401
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,973
<i>to be out of that dress.</i>

402
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,383
It was weirdly hot.

403
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:48,537
Oh, yeah,
it's probably because

404
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,460
it was a cotton
and plastic blend.

405
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:51,743
But not to worry.

406
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,058
We're gonna
catch these guys

407
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,597
and get back to the worst
date of your life.

408
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,622
No.

409
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:56,711
Nothing will
ever be worse

410
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,604
than the date I had
with my aunt's dentist.

411
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:59,854
You should try
some of this.

412
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,258
Okay.

413
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,567
Oh. Okay. Hold on.
Hmm?

414
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,196
Yeah, dessert
is out of the question.

415
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,567
What was your
worst date ever?

416
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,973
I think it's, like,
a 50-way tie.

417
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:14,441
The last lady I went out with
burst into tears

418
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:17,006
when I told her
I was a Gemini.

419
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,192
Wow.

420
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,274
Hey, those people
left that door open.

421
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,070
I bet there's a better vantage
point from the roof.

422
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,860
Mmm, and I bet it doesn't
smell like old cheese.

423
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,494
Okay, that's hurtful.

424
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,224
Shall we?
Yeah.

425
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,892
So what else
don't I know?

426
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:30,886
You cooking meth?

427
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:31,849
You breaking bad?

428
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,419
How many phones
do you have?

429
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,278
I'm sorry,
I need to clarify

430
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,368
something
I said earlier.

431
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:38,036
Sergeant Jeffords
was correct

432
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,574
when he said
that his choice to go back

433
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:41,947
in the field that night
was an impulse decision.

434
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,416
He didn't even take the time
to stop and gear up, so...

435
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,377
<i>What?</i>
So...

436
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,883
You didn't have
your vest on?

437
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,160
Oh, no.
Oh, goodness.

438
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,442
I shouldn't
have said that.

439
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:51,884
I feel I may
have made things worse.

440
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,904
Wait.
I can fix this, Ray.

441
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,667
Now is not the time, Boyle.
Hush!

442
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:57,110
I want to hear this.

443
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,456
Boyle, let's not make big...
Hush.

444
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:00,187
Truth time.

445
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:01,471
We love your husband.

446
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:02,431
He's a great cop.

447
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,419
We will do anything
to protect him.

448
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,792
And you have incredibly
attractive hands.

449
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:08,683
And you, what the hell
are you doing,

450
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:09,773
lying to your wife?

451
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,087
Unless you want to
end up moving

452
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,914
into my ex-wife's new
boyfriend's basement with me,

453
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,326
you better man up.

454
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,992
Don't you ever
keep anything

455
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,371
from this
beautiful woman again.

456
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:19,294
Seriously,
you are beautiful.

457
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:20,864
Oh.
If he ever lies to you again,

458
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,526
you can call me.

459
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,288
I'm sorry, honey.

460
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,572
I just didn't
want you to worry.

461
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,168
Baby, I am always
gonna worry about you.

462
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,322
But if you feel
like you're ready,

463
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:31,764
then get your ass
back in the field.

464
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,875
But if you ever keep
anything from me again,

465
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,407
I will leave you
for this short, earnest man

466
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,107
and his ex-wife's new
boyfriend's apartment.

467
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,260
I know you're kidding,

468
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,344
but Hercules is actually
a very good landlord.

469
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:44,267
Sometimes, when they go
on nice vacations,

470
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,775
I'm allowed
to use the hot tub.

471
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,198
Man, I don't know
how Batman does it.

472
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,674
It is super scary
up here.

473
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,956
<i>Hey, will you grab
the binoculars?</i>

474
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,206
They're in
my stakeout bag.

475
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:57,122
Your stakeout bag
is 98% nuts.

476
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,150
I get snacky.

477
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,655
Besides,
nuts are super healthy.

478
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,938
They're, like, 0% fat.

479
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,021
Jake, that's not
true at all.

480
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:05,041
It's actually
the opposite.

481
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,958
What?
That nut vendor lied to me.

482
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,582
I think a pigeon
just flew out of your car.

483
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,639
Yeah.

484
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,402
The windows
don't exactly roll up.

485
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:15,813
The car's
a piece of crap.

486
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:18,794
Why do you love it
so much?

487
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:21,166
You really
want to know?

488
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,732
I was two days out of
the academy, super nervous.

489
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,077
Saw this guy
run out of a bodega,

490
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,071
clutching
a bunch of cash.

491
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:29,341
So I pursued him
on foot, 11 blocks.

492
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:31,426
Finally catch him,
cuff him,

493
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:34,694
throw him up against
that car.

494
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,651
Turned out there was a for sale
sign in the window,

495
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,895
and, it being the best day
of my life, I bought it.

496
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,779
Thus began the debt.

497
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,967
Crushing debt.

498
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,986
Yeah, you do know me.

499
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,620
Nut?

500
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:47,743
Only if you throw it.

501
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,282
Ready?
Ready?

502
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:52,390
Mm-hmm.
Nice.

503
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,982
You ready?
Uh-huh.

504
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,437
What are you doing?

505
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:01,752
Trying to catch it
in your nose?

506
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,509
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

507
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,176
It's Holt.
Keep practicing.

508
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,459
Okay.

509
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,421
Peralta.

510
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:09,446
Oh, good news, Peralta.

511
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,504
I found someone
from the night shift

512
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:11,882
to relieve you
on your stakeout.

513
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,415
Ooh.
Still make Times Square.

514
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,172
Um...

515
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:19,575
You know, Captain,
hold off on the relief team.

516
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,891
We're already here.

517
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,301
Plus I'm curious
to see what happens.

518
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,615
<i>Okay, it's your call.</i>

519
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:24,834
All right.

520
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,361
What did Holt want?

521
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,546
Just checking in.

522
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,586
How you doing?
Any progress?

523
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:34,419
Yep.
Watch.

524
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,343
The key is volume.
I see that.

525
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:39,268
So be honest.

526
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,263
If you'd won the bet,

527
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,384
were you really
gonna destroy my car?

528
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,558
No.
I was gonna drive it.

529
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,873
So I could learn stick.

530
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,893
You wouldn't.

531
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,624
I would.
Would've been, like,

532
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:53,023
No.
No!

533
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,586
Hey, hey!

534
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:56,548
<i>There's our guys.</i>

535
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,086
What's the play here?

536
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,241
Just follow my lead.

537
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,869
Give me the ring.

538
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,216
Now give me some nuts.

539
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,685
I'm snacky.

540
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,449
All right, fine,
darling.

541
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,954
I'll ask him.
Will that make you happy?

542
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:09,917
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

543
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,039
We're kind of busye.

544
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:13,186
Yeah, my girlfriend,
here, thinks we're lost.

545
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:14,886
No, I know we're lost.

546
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,488
I think he's an idiot.
Idiot?

547
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,611
You know why
we're out here

548
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,502
in the middle
of the night, Susan?

549
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:20,880
I was gonna
propose to you.

550
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,572
On the Brooklyn bridge,
where we met.

551
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:24,600
Brooklyn bridge?

552
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,785
We met on
the Manhattan bridge.

553
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,869
You know what?
This is over.

554
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,081
Say good-bye to the ring
and everything it represents.

555
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,127
You son of a bitch!

556
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,985
Hey, hey.
Stop yelling

557
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,654
hey, no one talks to Susan
like that.

558
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,256
And you know what else? On the ground!
NYPD! NYPD!

559
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,731
You're under arrest.

560
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:40,884
Nice work.

561
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,230
You too.

562
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm sad y'all
are arresting me,

563
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:48,229
but I gotta say,
I'm glad you're back together.

564
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:53,291
Hey.
I need to talk to you.

565
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,208
Oh.
It's happening?

566
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,196
Remember when I took those
bus for you?

567
00:18:58,197 --> 00:18:59,542
Okay, let's do this.

568
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:00,856
I think you're sweet...

569
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,524
I didn't know
it was you.

570
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,704
When I jumped in front
of those bullets,

571
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,883
I didn't know
who I was protecting.

572
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,904
I just saw a gun
and an NYPD vest,

573
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,570
and so
I dove on instinct.

574
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:11,981
You've been extra nice
to me

575
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,519
because you thought
I'd risked my life for you.

576
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,271
But I only did
what every good cop would do.

577
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:19,738
When you finally
go out with me, and you will,

578
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:20,990
it'll be because
I do things

579
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:24,837
that only Charles Boyle
would do.

580
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,280
Um, actually,
I have a coat in here.

581
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:34,102
It's, uh... it's,
like... actually, I see it.

582
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:35,871
It's, like... it's blue... it's,
like, right...

583
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,936
Excellent job on the stakeout
last night.

584
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:42,340
<i>I'm glad to see you two
still work well together</i>

585
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,751
despite that
ridiculous bet.

586
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,353
Thanks.
Me too.

587
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,629
And I appreciate your turning
down the relief team.

588
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,905
I'm not sure
they could've made that bust.

589
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,572
Yeah.
Right.

590
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:54,074
The relief team.

591
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:58,402
So... sorry you lost so much
money last night.

592
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:00,645
Guess you can add it
to your list of bad dates.

593
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,434
Nah, it still goes on
the good date list.

594
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,577
You know, 'cause we caught
the bad guys.

595
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:07,762
That's very mature
of you.

596
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,718
Well,
I am very mature man.

597
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,963
<i>Package for Amy Santiago.</i>

598
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,083
That's me.

599
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:16,225
Special delivery from
Jake Peralta to say,

600
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:17,507
"thanks for last night."

601
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,111
Oh, no.
I forgot to cancel.

602

603
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,348

<i>Sir, you don't have to...</i>

604
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,305
Okay.

00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,837
<i>Okay.
All right, so...</i>

Okay, no, no,
no, no, no.

608

All right, stepping in,
stepping in.

609
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:33,345
I'll take this bullet
for you.

610
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:35,011
Ugh. Hitchcock,
what are you doing?

we all gonna... no?

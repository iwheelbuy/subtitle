Use Gina.
She's my assistant,

162
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,171
and she has something
to offer.

163
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,872
Trust me.

164
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,008
Man, don't be hacking
into my stuff.

165
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,655
(Charles)
Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.

166
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,178
What are you two doing here?

167
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,045
You're a Detective,
you detect it out.

168
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,079
Good one, bro.

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,614
- I know, bro.
- Yeah, bro.

170
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,548
Wow, it's like watching
meet the press.

171
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,749
Boone reconsidered.

172
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:15,150
He wants you
to take a look at the files.

173
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:17,552
Well, that's unexpected,
but...

174
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,819
All right, fine, I'll...

175
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,620
[Laughs]
It's not a file, bro.

176
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:22,455
It's a doughnut,
because you're cops.

177
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,422
You sure?

178
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,757
[Laughs]

179
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,957
All right, I don't care

180
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,025
if it's not our jurisdiction,

181
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,192
we're solving this.

182
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:29,426
Would you like me
to, uh,

183
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:30,660
file that for you, Jake?

184
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,766
Just ask for the doughnut,
Scully?

185
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:32,795
Can I have the doughnut,
please?

186
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:33,929
Yes.

187
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,996
Thanks.

188
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,197
[Sighs]

189
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:41,320
It's good to see you, Sal.

190
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,888
I'm so sorry
about the fire.

191
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,422
I can't believe it's gone,
Jakey, all of it.

192
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,656
The pizza oven.

193
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,657
The first dollar bill
I ever made.

194
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,292
[Tearing up]
The 7-up fridge.

195
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,827
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You'll rebuild.

196
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,962
The fire department's
been asking a lot of questions.

197
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,864
Oh, fire department questions.
Let me guess.

198
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,365
"Uh, what part of my face
do I put food in?"

199
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,432
"How do you count to one?"

200
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,967
"What's air?"
[Laughs]

201
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,669
They think I torched
my own place.

202
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,002
You know I wouldn't do
something like that, right?

203
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:07,003
Yeah, of course.

204
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,003
But can you think of anybody

205
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,304
who might've done it?

206
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,538
I could think
of ten pizzerias

207
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,839
that want me
out of the game.

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,407
That jerk Mario
comes to mind.

209
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:15,375
We share a delivery radius.

210
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,809
(Charles) Mario is number ten
overall in Brooklyn,

211
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,477
and rising fast.

212
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,645
He might've wanted
to move up the ladder.

213
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:20,745
Of one foodie weirdo's

214
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,513
personal pizza email blast?

215
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:23,648
Yeah.

216
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:25,382
Okay, we'll start with him,

217
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,650
then we'll move on to the rest
of your competition,

218
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,951
see if anything suspicious
turns up.

219
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,619
It'll be
the perfect opportunity

220
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,053
to update my rankings.

221
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:32,487
Can we stop at home
for a pizza bib?

222
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:33,888
No, Charles,
we gotta go fast.

223
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,355
Right, right,
I'll just use my work bib.

224
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,923
No, no bib.

225
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,958
We're gonna solve this
for you, Sal.

226
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,418
Sit tight.

227
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,594
The guy who did the safe

228
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,928
in the second apartment,
what was his name?

229
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,529
Cone.

230
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,051
"C" as in "Captain."
"O" as in "overlooked."

231
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:50,053
- What?
- Nothing.

232
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,066
She said "C" as in "Captain,"
"O" as in "over..."

233
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,835
Yeah, I know
how to spell cone.

234
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,436
Okay.

235
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:58,905
So, Ropesburg P.D.

236
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,840
- You know someone there?
- Nope.

237
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,341
So you were looking
for a new job?

238
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,476
- Nope.
- Weird.

239
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:07,811
They just offered you Captain
without considering anyone else?

240
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:10,480
Like Scully...

241
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,881
Because he's got
so many years on the force.

242
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,515
Hey, guys,
I think I put my gun

243
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,717
in one of these boxes,
and I don't know which.

244
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,819
You have a problem with me
that you want to talk about?

245
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:22,388
Me? No, I am just
filing evidence, sir.

246
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,524
Found my gun.
It was in my holster.

247
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:26,825
My holster's on my butt.

248
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,883
Good solve, Scully.

249
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,561
Mario, this pie needs work.

250
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:32,971
Good consistency
on the crust,

251
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:35,797
but the cheese-to-sauce ratio
is a travesty.

252
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,797
[Spits]

253
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,599
Do you have to spit?

254
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,866
In a word, yes.

255
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,500
Amateurs go tasting,
they fill up,

256
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,034
and they lose their palate
by the third slice.

257
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,602
I take this very seriously.

258
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:45,836
So, Mario...

259
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,471
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

260
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,772
Your credit card transactions
are down by 1/3

261
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,107
in the last six months.

262
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,508
Meanwhile, over at Sal's,

263
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,876
it was a bunch of smiling faces

264
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:54,909
and happy stomachs.

265
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,378
One night, you snapped.

266
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,948
A little gasoline... fah!
A little match.

267
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,450
And poof! No more Sal's.
How right am I?

268
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,551
The night of the fire,
I was at my father's funeral.

269
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,886
Oh...
My condolences.

270
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,019
[Spits]

271
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Ugh.

272
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:10,488
(Charles)
Gino...

273
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,790
This pizza is much better
than last time.

274
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,090
You've always
ranked dead last

275
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:16,058
in structural integrity
and sauce.

276
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,993
But way more importantly,
I did a little research,

277
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:22,096
and it turns out you did
six months in prison for a b&e.

278
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,931
I did.
The night of the fire,

279
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:25,933
I was at the prison
giving a motivational speech

280
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,984
on how parolees
can turn their lives around.

281
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,735
Well, it's good to hear
that the system works,

282
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,003
and you are welcome.

283
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,438
Have a good one.

284
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:36,173
This is a dead end.

285
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,707
We've gotta check out
that crime scene.

286
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:39,475
Can't.
Firemen locked it down.

287
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,076
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.

288
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,916
Those hose monkeys
can't stop us.

289
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,447
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.

290
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:49,182
Have a seat.

291
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,184
It says here
you were an I.T. Specialist

292
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,885
with the board of ed
for two years.

293
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,094
Well, I know my way around
a computer, that's for sure.

294
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:57,756
Query: What's your
favorite Jay-Z song?

295
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,090
I'm sorry?

296
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,424
Favorite Jay-Z song?

297
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,892
[Chuckles]
She's kidding.

298
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,593
Hmm. No, I'm not.
What is it?

299
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,729
I don't know.

300
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,996
- I'm sorry about her.
- Okay.

301
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,025
What's your experience
with cyber-security?

302
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,167
Uh, well, I added
encryption software...

303
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,203
But seriously, what's
your favorite Jay-Z song?

304
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,205
I don't know! Big pimpin'?
It's big pimpin'!

305
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:18,407
Mm, wrong answer, friend.

306
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,913
And that's, um,
how I got involved in,

307
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,610
you know, systems analysis.

308
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:26,178
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

309
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,113
There's no need
to be nervous.

310
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:31,448
Yeah, we're all just calm,
cool, collected...

311
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,049
- Wahh!
- [Screams]

312
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,984
[Laughs]
Oops.

313
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,687
Was that a little sudden?

314
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,657
What would you say is your
biggest weakness as an employee?

315
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,827
Um...

316
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,811
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

317
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,164
He said, "what's
your biggest weakness

318
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,666
[muffled]
As an employee?"

319
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,774
That's just gross.

320
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm sorry,
I just have

321
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,201
a skootch of gingivitis.

322
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,670
So I'm trying
to treat that as best I can.

323
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:55,838
Sorry.
You seem disgusted.

324
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,573
Here's an itemized list

325
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,608
of everything taken
from the garden apartment.

326
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,710
TV, computer...

327
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,045
"Ster-b-eo"?

328
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,514
Uh-oh, spelling error.

329
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:06,715
That's not very Captain-y.

330
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,002
Oh, my God, enough.

331
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,786
I just think that you meant
"stereo," not "ster-b-eo."

332
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,154
Did you mean "ster-b-eo,"
Captain?

333
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:16,926
That's it.
Get in my car, now.

334
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,052
And if you say another word,

335
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,527
I promise you,
you will regret it.

336
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:22,963
Aye aye, cap...
Ow, okay.

337
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,852
Fine, I regret it.
Ah... I'll go. I'm going.

338
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,601
These firemen
are not moving.

339
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:30,002
We gotta distract 'em.

340
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,003
Tell 'em
your little boy's cat

got stuck up in a tree.

342
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,238
Ooh, undercover work.
I love it.

343
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,639
I need more back story.

344
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,707
First off, can it be
my daughter's cat?

345
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,608
Okay, but if you get made
because of that, it's on you.

346
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:41,543
Fine.
Let's talk about the cat.

347
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:43,143
Short-hair, long-hair?
Tabby?

348
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,811
Short-hair, calico.

349
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,956
The son is adopted.
Your wife is in a coma.

350
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,916
Oh, that's brutal.
I like it.

351
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,650
Hey, guys?
Guys, I really need your help.

352
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,883
My little boy,
Brian, my angel,

353
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,286
I bought him
a short-haired calico

354
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,970
after my wife fell into a coma...
Motorcycle crash.

355
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,589
And now the cat's
stuck in a tree.

356
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:03,890

He's a cute kid.

357
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,157
Kinda looks like you.
Handsome guy.

358
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,525
Handsome little guy.

359
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,093
Oh, hey.
Just got locked out, so...

360
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,894
He doesn't care.

[Grunts]

362
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,063
Brian was adopted,
so he has abandonment issues.

363
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,735
Just struck out
at tee-ball last week.

364
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,165
Everyone called him
"cryin' Brian."

365

(Boone)
Hello, Peralta.

366
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,270
Aah!

367
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,538
You looking for something?

368
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,638
What is the deal with you

369
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,273
and this second-rate
pizza joint?

370
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,041
This place
is a Brooklyn institution,

371
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,675
and I'm here
because you think Sal did it

372
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:31,675
and you're wrong!

373
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,710
He did do it!

374
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,177
Sal was in financial trouble,

375
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,779
he has no alibi,

376
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,634
and in cases of arson,
the owner always did it.

377
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,917
What's going on, sir?

378
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,219
What's going on
is that Peralta

379
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,987
has screwed with me
for the last time,

380
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,322
and now he's gonna pay.

381
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:47,524
Oh, you know what, Boone?
Any time you want to...

Hey, break it up!
Now!

Hey, hey, hey!
Don't tell my guys what to do!

390
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,543
Don't tell me what
to tell people what to do!

391
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,044
Well, make me not do it,
tough guy.

392
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,346
Uh-oh.

[All grunting]

00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,334
Hey, break it up!

395
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,380
I apologize, marshal Boone,

396
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,082
for Detective Peralta's
actions,

397
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,017
something I find myself
doing quite frequently.

398
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,552
In my defense,
I was the only one

399
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,254
saying we
should stop hitting.

400
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:26,255
Stop hitting them!

401
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,091
Kicking them will hurt more!

402
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,629
Okay, I'm a reasonable man,
so I'm just gonna say this.

403
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,898
Fire Peralta immediately.

404
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,199
He started a fight.

405
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,634
He overstepped
his jurisdiction.

406
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,527
And he's obsessed
with this pizza place.

407
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:41,105
What I'm obsessed with
is how you're bungling

408
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,373
this investigation.

409
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,440
They should
write a song about it

410
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,075
called welcome to the bungle.

411
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,310
Seriously, why are you

412
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:47,478
dragging Sal's pizza
through the mud?

413
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,479
That place is special.

414
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,147
Why's it special?

415
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,448
Because it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood!

416
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:52,650
Well...

417
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:53,651
According to Charles's
email blast,

418
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,652
it's actually number eight.

420
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:56,954
Of course,
it's the only one

421
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,122
that measures mouth-feel.

422
00:13:58,123 --> 00:13:59,123
What, are you kidding
right now?

423
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,157
This isn't about pizza.

424
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:02,359
What's it actually about?

425
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:05,295
When I was a kid,
I was shortstop

426
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,429
on my little league team.

427
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,998
Oh, my God.

00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,433
It's the truth.
It's not a brag.

429
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,702
My dad was the coach,
and after every game,

430
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,370
he would take the team
to Sal's.

431
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:16,040
Halfway through our last season,
he left me and my mom,

432
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,009
and the worst part about it
was that I couldn't

433
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,011
go with him
to Sal's anymore.

434
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:21,980
Well, that's certainly not

435
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,414
what I expected this
to be about.

like that?

You're a cop and...

00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:40,131
And I'm a firefighter,
but underneath all of it,

442
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:44,035
we're just two boys
whose dads abandoned them.

solve this thing, together.

What's going on?

Did you drive me out here
to kill me?

456
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,629
I thought about it,

457
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,130
but then I put
that thought on hold.

458

This is Ropesburg?

You wanted this offer
so badly,

a chance at the job.

Are you here to reconsider?

He quit to start
a carpet cleaning business,

than being Captain here

00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,040
that you interviewed today,

482
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,341
who do you think
I should hire?

483
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,212
Well, the interviews
got a little off-track.

484
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,382
But I'd go with Simon Walker.

485
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,050
Computer science degree,
worked for the board of ed

486
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,051
for ten years.

487
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,219
That guy?
No way.

488
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,754
He yelled at me
when I asked him

489
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,223
the same question about Jay-Z
three times in a row.

490
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,524
Why does that matter?

491
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,326
Because whoever
takes this I.T. Job

492
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,794
is gonna have
to deal with Hitchcock

493
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,762
asking how to log in
to his email

494
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,830
every single day
forever.

495
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,666
How do you think
Professor short fuse

496
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,692
is gonna handle that?

497
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,436
Fine, what about this guy?

498
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,339
Mm, no.
He was scared of everything.

499
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,076
Do you remember Rosa's reaction
last time the printer jammed?

500
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,682
I'll pay for that.

501
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,384
Fine, what was with
the flossing?

502
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,587
Mm, a precinct is a pretty
gross place, ter-bear.

503
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,724
There's blood, wounds,
Scully's feet.

504
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:50,292
You need a strong stomach,

505
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,161
and that lady
did not have one.

506
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,764
Plus, we already have
the perfect candidate already:

507
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,232
Savant.

508
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,725
That punk who hacked us?

509
00:16:57,735 --> 00:16:59,169
Precisely.

510
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,139
Captain,
turn your greatest weakness

511
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,473
into your greatest strength,

512
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,142
like Paris Hilton
re: Her sex tape.

513
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,109
Get to the point.

514
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,412
Savant tore our walls down,

515
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,447
but he can build them
back up,

516
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,549
taller and thicker
than ever.

517
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,701
But how can we be sure
he won't turn on us?

518
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,320
His mom ratted him out,

519
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:19,890
so I bet he'd love
a steady paycheck

520
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:21,759
to get out of
that snitch's house.

521
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,128
[Laughs]
If I had a mic right now,

522
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:26,587
I'd drop it.

523
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,799
There we have it.

524
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,570
And here's the file
you wanted.

525
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:37,174
Well, it's hard to believe
I'm gonna say this,

526
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,410
because I've spent most
of my adult life hating you

527
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,278
and everything
you stand for, but...

528
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,479
Thanks.

529
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:45,549
I'm not gonna lie,
my therapist

530
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,151
is gonna be
very proud of me.

531
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:48,519
That's weird.

532
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,653
Any reason you can think of
one of your guys

533
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,787
would've
forced this cabinet open

534
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,788
while they
were putting the fire out?

535
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,423
No, no.
I can't.

536
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:56,560
Looks like it was jimmied open
with a crowbar.

537
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:59,295
Oh, my God.
I know who did it.

538
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,297
Come on, I'll explain it
on the way down.

539
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,166
Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,768
I can't believe
I'm offering this to a cop,

541
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,703
but...

542
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,205
Do you want
to take the pole down?

543
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:09,797
Oh, my God, yes.

544
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:12,710
Whee!

545
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,578
Let justice be served.

546
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,180
- Did you get it?
- Uh-huh. My turn?

547
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,781
Nope. No time.

548
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
Whoo!

549
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,272
We know you burned down
Sal's, gino.

550
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,474
You hated him because his pizza
was better than yours.

551
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,142
That's not true.

552
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,577
Gino's pizza's
always been the tastiest.

553
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,912
Wrong.

554
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,180
According to Boyle's
email blast,

555
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,615
it was downright lousy before.

556
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,717
That's what made it
so suspicious

557
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,252
when he suddenly loved it.

558
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,288
[Distorted]
Much better than last time.

559
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,555
[Spits]

560
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,856
The crust was charred,

561
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,758
the cheese was stringy
and flavorless,

562
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,926
but the sauce.

563
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,395
Oh, Marone, the sauce.

564
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,429
Continue.

565
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,630
And that was your mistake.

566
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,931
You didn't
just burn Sal's down,

567
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,300
you also stole
his secret sauce recipe.

568
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,169
Here's a picture

569
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,271
of the cabinet in which
said recipe was held.

570
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,683
Busted open with a crowbar.

571
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,274
Look familiar?

572
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,610
Also, your so-called
motivational speech

573
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,646
down at the prison
ended at 5:00 P.M.,

574
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,448
leaving you plenty of time
to get back to Sal's

575
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,949
and burn it to the ground.

576
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,552
So I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

577
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,654
(Both) Gino Bianucci,
you're under arrest...

578
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,223
- [Clears throat] Excuse me. No.
- Do you mind?

579
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,824
This is my collar...
I think I can handle this.

580
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,259
If I'm not wrong.

581
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,261
Yeah, but I actually
did all the work.

582
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,763
See, I knew you would...
You know what? Fine.

583
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,431
Go ahead, I don't care.

584
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,875
Gino Bianucci, you're
under arrest for arson. Yes!

585
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
- Said it first.
- Real mature.

586
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,202
Very mature.

587
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,737
Off we go.

588
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,507
So what'd you think
of Ropesburg?

589
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,543
It's, uh... quaint.

590
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,345
It's whack,
and you know it.

591
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,481
Their number-one crime
is tricycle theft.

592
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,249
There's a bakery
attached to the precinct.

593
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,517
Come on, Santiago.

594
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,286
You never would've
taken that job,

595
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,255
so why'd you even care
that they offered it to me?

596
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,991
I can't help it.
I'm competitive.

597
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,294
I have seven brothers,
and I was the only girl.

598
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,429
I always had to fight
for a place at the table.

599
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,997
Well, you're not the only girl
at the table anymore.

600
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,332
We work in a police force
full of dudes.

601
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,853
We gotta have
each other's backs, okay?

602
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:06,569
You saying you have my back?

603
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:08,270
Yeah, I got your back.

604
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,638
Don't smile.
I'm still mad at you.

605
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:11,240
I thought we were
having a moment.

606
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:12,708
Moment's over.
Shut up.

607
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,922
(Hitchcock)
Hey, sarge.

608
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,779
He made my computer smarter.

609
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,781
All I have to do
is put my thumb on that thing,

610
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,550
and it opens up
all my electric mails.

611
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,920
[Laughs]
You seem real smart, man.

612
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,256
Oh, and look,
and you play with toys.

613
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:29,291
Savant, you're part
of the nine-nine now.

614
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,559
We look after each other.

615
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,627
Hey, ball,

616
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,729
if savant
was to do anything

617
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,569
to harm this precinct,
would I destroy him?

618
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:41,571
Answer uncertain.
Try again.

619
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,508
Peralta, fire marshal Boone
just called.

620
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,510
He told me you should
check your drawer?

621
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,916
Oh, look at that.

622
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,318
I've been booned.

623
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,586
Well, the joke's on him,

624
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,001
because I was out
of shaving cream.

625
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:01,058
I see we are once again at war
with the fire department.

626
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,465
You are not to retaliate.

627
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,986
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of it, sir.

628
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,866
In fact, I'm gonna send over
a little peace offering:

629
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,066
Some of Sal's famous sauce.

630
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,066
Now, Boyle!

631
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,365
[Alarm blares]

632
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,445
Fire! Fire! Fire!

633
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,199
Pleasure working
with you, Boone.

634
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,639
Run, Charles!

635
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,409
[Laughter]

636
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,655
Come on... whoa!
Get that guy!

637
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:27,600

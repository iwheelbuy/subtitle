1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,591
Oh, this is amazing.

2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:03,776
This is so amazing.

3
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:04,738
Everything about this
is amazing.

4
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:05,699
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,916
A virus got on the server

6
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:08,389
and sent all of us an email

7
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,350
with everyone's
search histories.

8
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:10,503
Check this out.

9
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:11,656
Sergeant Jeffords
searched the Internet

10
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,514
for "undiscovered muscle."

11
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,500
I was working out
and saw a muscle in my shoulder

12
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,036
I'd never seen before.

13
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,214
I thought it might've
been a scientific discovery.

14
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:20,624
Listen to this.
Scully searched for

15
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,284
"how much fudge
is in a calorie?"

16
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,844
I never found the answer,
but it was a good question.

17
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,607
Boyle looked up,
"how to make desk yogurt."

18
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:30,681
Yes, I did, and I am thrilled
with the results.

19
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,603
Although the jar
is really hot.

20
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,557
That's gross.
And Amy searched for

21
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,247
"Daniel Craig hands"
plus "close up."

22
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:38,272
Ugh.

23
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,489
You should talk.

24
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,668
You searched for
"cheapest date possible."

25
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:44,005
And I wear that search
like badge of honor.

26
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:46,152
So, ready for dinner?

27
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:48,447
Here we go.
[Grunts]

28
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,867
Would you like
something sweet?

29
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,693
Or maybe savory?

30
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:53,647
Apple pie...
And I'm stuck.

31
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,634
I'm stuck!

32
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,261

â™ª

34
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,597
Peralta.

35
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:22,408
Hey, Sal.
To what do I owe the honor?

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,042
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,965
Yeah, we'll be right there.

38
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,822
Boyle...

39
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,626
(Jake)
No!

40
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,196
I can't believe Sal's
is gone.

41
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:35,861
This place
is an institution.

42
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,175
It's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

43
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:39,417
Well, eighth-best.

44
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:40,825
But yeah, a tragedy.

45
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:43,004
I mean, any food-related crime
is a tragedy.

46
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,542
[Siren blares]

47
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,423
Oh, no.
Heads up, fire marshal.

48
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:56,594
Oh, Boone.
What's that nimrod doing here?

49
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:58,163
Hey, Peralta.

50
00:01:58,196 --> 00:01:59,636
Hey, Boone.

51
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,206
What are you doing here,
you nimrod?

52
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,488
Uh, there was a fire.

53
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,505
Big question is,
what are you doing here?

54
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,227
What, did somebody call in
a missing doughnut?

55
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,925
Uh, actually
someone reported

56
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,141
they couldn't find
your head.

57
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,807
But we found it.
It was up your butt.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,111
(Jake) You're a fireman,
you should know

59
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,722
how to treat that burn.

60
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:16,355
Joke's on you,
'cause this is a fire,

61
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:18,501
which means it is
fire department jurisdiction.

62
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:19,814
So why don't you back off

63
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,543
and let New York's bravest
handle it?

64
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:23,178
You know they only
call you that because

65
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,875
"New York's best
at spraying stuff with water"

66
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:25,837
is too wordy.

67
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:26,926
Ha, well, it's too bad

68
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,111
we all can't be as awesome

69
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:29,744
as New York's finest,

70
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,601
which by the way,
sounds like my mom

71
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,875
describing her dishware,
which... and she's dead,

72
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,637
so let's tread lightly
on the response.

73
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,015
- That's not fair.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,648
Well, look, we heard
this might be arson,

75
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:39,993
so we wanted
to check it out.

76
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,618
No, I'm not letting you
onto my crime scene.

77
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,445
Okay?

78
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,303
All right, fine.
You know what?

79
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,595
You're not invited
to our next murder.

80
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,099
Good solve on
the Herman Avenue burglaries.

81
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,701
Finish up the paperwork
as soon as possible.

82
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,078
Your wish is my command.

83
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,224
No, that was
actually a command.

84
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,466
So my command
is your command.

85
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,445
Well, then I guess you still
have all three of your wishes.

86
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:03,919
- You're not a genie.
- I know that.

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,712
Okay.
We're leaving.

88
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,659
What was the name
of the clerk we questioned

89
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,822
about the second burglary?

90
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:11,604
Where do farts go?

91
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,590
I was reading
Scully's searches.

92
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,001
Hey,
why'd you do a search

93
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,891
for "magic-themed
singles night"?

94
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:18,363
My last four dates
were really boring,

95
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,074
so I thought
I'd mix things up.

96
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,079
Oh, wow.
[Laughs]

97
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,596
[Poof]

98
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:27,750
Ta-da!

99
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,415
Oh, no.

100
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,568
What about you?

101
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,721
Why were you looking
for real estate

102
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,226
in Ropesburg, New Jersey?

103
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,604
Ropesburg P.D.
Offered me a job

104
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,175
as their new police Captain.

105
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,135
I turned it down.

106
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:39,056
Oh!

107
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,139
You... Captain.
[Chuckles]

108
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,830
Oh... that's super...

109
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,943
Super cool.

110
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,975
If we're gonna figure out
what happened at Sal's,

111
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:56,449
we've gotta
get past those firemen.

112
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,139
We need access.
How 'bout this?

113
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,613
We light a bunch of fires
throughout Brooklyn,

114
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:03,207
and when the firemen
go to "fight the fires,"

115
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,385
we walk right into Sal's,
the crime scene's ours.

116
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,722
Why do we want to start a turf
war with the fire department?

117
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,260
I feel very uncomfortable
saying this to you,

118
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,348
but it doesn't seem
like it's worth it...

119
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,918
- Unless you think it is.
- I do.

120
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,744
Like I said,
Sal's is an institution,

121
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,409
and it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

122
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,555
I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's
is only the eighth-best.

123
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,503
I put out a weekly Brooklyn
pizza-ranking email blast.

124
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,520
Sal's has
the fourth-best texture,

125
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,539
ninth-best crust,
twelfth-best cheese,

126
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,005
and honestly, they're only
seventh in mouth-feel.

127
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,414
"Mouth-feel"?
What is that?

128
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,888
The inside of your cheeks
are very sensitive.

129
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:30,977
It's like the inside
of your thighs,

130
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:31,936
except with a tongue.

131
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,252
Ugh, God.

132
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,045
Look, no, Sal's
has the secret sauce recipe

133
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,010
that puts all the other
pizza places to shame.

134
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,656
But more importantly,
fire marshal Boone

135
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,770
is incapable of conducting
a crime investigation.

136
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,628
All fire marshals
are doofuses,

137
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,383
but Boone is King doofus
of doofus island.

138
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,728
Gasoline?

139
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,145
I'm pretty sure
that's water.

140
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,027
Only one way to tell.

141
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:54,806
There were more ways
to tell.

142
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,368
And he's their leader.

143
00:04:57,369 --> 00:05:00,764
Captain, here's the mope
who hacked our computer system.

144
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:03,454
His mother turned him in.
His name is Corey Park.

145
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:04,607
My name is savant.

146
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,691
His web handle is "savant."

147
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,689
His people name
is Corey Park.

148
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,821
Why'd you target us with
your computer virus, Corey?

149
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,390
I don't know, I was bored,
and it was easy

150
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,056
to break into
your weak-ass system.

151
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,594
It was like taking candy
from a baby.

152
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,052
Why are you giving candy
to a baby in the first place?

153
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:22,095
Don't give candy to a baby!
They can't brush their teeth!

154
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:25,684
Yes, sergeant, it is unwise
to give babies candy.

155
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:26,932
If it's so easy
for this gentlemen

156
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,597
to break into our system,
we may need to hire

157
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:29,878
a new I.T. Director.

158
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,839
Why don't you and Gina
get together on that?

159
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,499
I doubt I'll need Gina's help.

160
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,547
I'm sure she's busy anyway.

161
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,352
Use Gina.
She's my assistant,

162
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,594
and she has something
to offer.

163
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,228
Trust me.

164
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:47,239
Man, don't be hacking
into my stuff.

165
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,781
(Charles)
Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.

166
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,243
What are you two doing here?

167
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:53,036
You're a Detective,
you detect it out.

168
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:54,029
Good one, bro.

169
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,503
- I know, bro.
- Yeah, bro.

170
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,360
Wow, it's like watching
meet the press.

171
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,513
Boone reconsidered.

172
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,819
He wants you
to take a look at the files.

173
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,125
Well, that's unexpected,
but...

174
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:04,342
All right, fine, I'll...

175
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,071
[Laughs]
It's not a file, bro.

176
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:07,834
It's a doughnut,
because you're cops.

177
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:08,762
You sure?

178
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:10,044
[Laughs]

179
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,197
All right, I don't care

180
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,221
if it's not our jurisdiction,

181
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,342
we're solving this.

182
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:14,527
Would you like me
to, uh,

183
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:15,712
file that for you, Jake?

184
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:16,774
Just ask for the doughnut,
Scully?

185
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:17,762
Can I have the doughnut,
please?

186
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:18,851
Yes.

187
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:19,875
Thanks.

188
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:21,029
[Sighs]

189
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:25,948
It's good to see you, Sal.

190
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,454
I'm so sorry
about the fire.

191
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,887
I can't believe it's gone,
Jakey, all of it.

192
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,072
The pizza oven.

193
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,993
The first dollar bill
I ever made.

194
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,563
[Tearing up]
The 7-up fridge.

195
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,997
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You'll rebuild.

196
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,048
The fire department's
been asking a lot of questions.

197
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,874
Oh, fire department questions.
Let me guess.

198
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,275
"Uh, what part of my face
do I put food in?"

199
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,300
"How do you count to one?"

200
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,774
"What's air?"
[Laughs]

201
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:48,369
They think I torched
my own place.

202
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,649
You know I wouldn't do
something like that, right?

203
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:50,610
Yeah, of course.

204
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,570
But can you think of anybody

205
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:52,819
who might've done it?

206
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,004
I could think
of ten pizzerias

207
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,253
that want me
out of the game.

208
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,759
That jerk Mario
comes to mind.

209
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,649
We share a delivery radius.

210
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,026
(Charles) Mario is number ten
overall in Brooklyn,

211
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,627
and rising fast.

212
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,749
He might've wanted
to move up the ladder.

213
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,805
Of one foodie weirdo's

214
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,503
personal pizza email blast?

215
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:06,593
Yeah.

216
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,258
Okay, we'll start with him,

217
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,475
then we'll move on to the rest
of your competition,

218
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:10,725
see if anything suspicious
turns up.

219
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,326
It'll be
the perfect opportunity

220
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:13,703
to update my rankings.

221
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,080
Can we stop at home
for a pizza bib?

222
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,426
No, Charles,
we gotta go fast.

223
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:17,834
Right, right,
I'll just use my work bib.

224
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,340
No, no bib.

225
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,294
We're gonna solve this
for you, Sal.

226
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:22,697
Sit tight.

227
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,785
The guy who did the safe

228
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,066
in the second apartment,
what was his name?

229
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,604
Cone.

230
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,026
"C" as in "Captain."
"O" as in "overlooked."

231
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,948
- What?
- Nothing.

232
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,881
She said "C" as in "Captain,"
"O" as in "over..."

233
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:35,579
Yeah, I know
how to spell cone.

234
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,118
Okay.

235
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:40,448
So, Ropesburg P.D.

236
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,306
- You know someone there?
- Nope.

237
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:43,748
So you were looking
for a new job?

238
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:45,797
- Nope.
- Weird.

239
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,000
They just offered you Captain
without considering anyone else?

240
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,564
Like Scully...

241
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:52,908
Because he's got
so many years on the force.

242
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,477
Hey, guys,
I think I put my gun

243
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,591
in one of these boxes,
and I don't know which.

244
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,610
You have a problem with me
that you want to talk about?

245
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:02,997
Me? No, I am just
filing evidence, sir.

246
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:06,008
Found my gun.
It was in my holster.

247
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,258
My holster's on my butt.

248
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,234
Good solve, Scully.

249
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,805
Mario, this pie needs work.

250
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,159
Good consistency
on the crust,

251
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,873
but the cheese-to-sauce ratio
is a travesty.

252
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:16,833
[Spits]

253
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,564
Do you have to spit?

254
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:19,780
In a word, yes.

255
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,349
Amateurs go tasting,
they fill up,

256
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,823
and they lose their palate
by the third slice.

257
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,328
I take this very seriously.

258
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,513
So, Mario...

259
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,083
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

260
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,292
Your credit card transactions
are down by 1/3

261
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,574
in the last six months.

262
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:31,920
Meanwhile, over at Sal's,

263
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,233
it was a bunch of smiling faces

264
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,225
and happy stomachs.

265
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,635
One night, you snapped.

266
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,103
A little gasoline... fah!
A little match.

267
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,466
And poof! No more Sal's.
How right am I?

268
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,483
The night of the fire,
I was at my father's funeral.

269
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,726
Oh...
My condolences.

270
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,814
[Spits]

271
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:47,775
Ugh.

272
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:49,184
(Charles)
Gino...

273
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,395
This pizza is much better
than last time.

274
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,643
You've always
ranked dead last

275
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,533
in structural integrity
and sauce.

276
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,352
But way more importantly,
I did a little research,

277
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:00,331
and it turns out you did
six months in prison for a b&e.

278
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,094
I did.
The night of the fire,

279
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:04,015
I was at the prison
giving a motivational speech

280
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:05,985
on how parolees
can turn their lives around.

281
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,666
Well, it's good to hear
that the system works,

282
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,844
and you are welcome.

283
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:12,183
Have a good one.

284
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,848
This is a dead end.

285
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:15,321
We've gotta check out
that crime scene.

286
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,019
Can't.
Firemen locked it down.

287
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,556
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.

288
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,323
Those hose monkeys
can't stop us.

289
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,674
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.

290
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,340
Have a seat.

291
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,262
It says here
you were an I.T. Specialist

292
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,895
with the board of ed
for two years.

293
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,017
Well, I know my way around
a computer, that's for sure.

294
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,573
Query: What's your
favorite Jay-Z song?

295
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:35,854
I'm sorry?

296
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,135
Favorite Jay-Z song?

297
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:38,544
[Chuckles]
She's kidding.

298
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,179
Hmm. No, I'm not.
What is it?

299
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,268
I don't know.

300
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,445
- I'm sorry about her.
- Okay.

301
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,394
What's your experience
with cyber-security?

302
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,450
Uh, well, I added
encryption software...

303
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,405
But seriously, what's
your favorite Jay-Z song?

304
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,328
I don't know! Big pimpin'?
It's big pimpin'!

305
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,403
Mm, wrong answer, friend.

306
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,769
And that's, um,
how I got involved in,

307
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,399
you know, systems analysis.

308
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,865
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

309
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:03,723
There's no need
to be nervous.

310
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,925
Yeah, we're all just calm,
cool, collected...

311
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,463
- Wahh!
- [Screams]

312
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,320
[Laughs]
Oops.

313
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,916
Was that a little sudden?

314
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:15,769
What would you say is your
biggest weakness as an employee?

315
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,851
Um...

316
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,757
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

317
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,016
He said, "what's
your biggest weakness

318
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,458
[muffled]
As an employee?"

319
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:24,522
That's just gross.

320
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:25,507
I'm sorry,
I just have

321
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,853
a skootch of gingivitis.

322
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:29,224
So I'm trying
to treat that as best I can.

323
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,345
Sorry.
You seem disgusted.

324
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,011
Here's an itemized list

325
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,966
of everything taken
from the garden apartment.

326
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,984
TV, computer...

327
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,266
"Ster-b-eo"?

328
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,636
Uh-oh, spelling error.

329
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:40,790
That's not very Captain-y.

330
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,986
Oh, my God, enough.

331
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,659
I just think that you meant
"stereo," not "ster-b-eo."

332
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,933
Did you mean "ster-b-eo,"
Captain?

333
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,595
That's it.
Get in my car, now.

334
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:51,677
And if you say another word,

335
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:54,052
I promise you,
you will regret it.

336
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,391
Aye aye, cap...
Ow, okay.

337
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:59,166
Fine, I regret it.
Ah... I'll go. I'm going.

338
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,805
These firemen
are not moving.

339
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,151
We gotta distract 'em.

340
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:04,113
Tell 'em
your little boy's cat

got stuck up in a tree.

342
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,218
Ooh, undercover work.
I love it.

343
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,564
I need more back story.

344
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,550
First off, can it be
my daughter's cat?

345
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,375
Okay, but if you get made
because of that, it's on you.

346
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,233
Fine.
Let's talk about the cat.

347
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,769
Short-hair, long-hair?
Tabby?

348
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,372
Short-hair, calico.

349
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,430
The son is adopted.
Your wife is in a coma.

350
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,312
Oh, that's brutal.
I like it.

351
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:26,818
Hey, guys?
Guys, I really need your help.

352
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,964
My little boy,
Brian, my angel,

353
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,310
I bought him
a short-haired calico

354
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,887
after my wife fell into a coma...
Motorcycle crash.

355
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,442
And now the cat's
stuck in a tree.

356
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:35,691
(Charles)
He's a cute kid.

357
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:36,908
Kinda looks like you.
Handsome guy.

358
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,221
Handsome little guy.

359
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,727
Oh, hey.
Just got locked out, so...

360
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,456
He doesn't care.

361
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,058
[Grunts]

362
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,459
Brian was adopted,
so he has abandonment issues.

363
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,065
Just struck out
at tee-ball last week.

364
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,439
Everyone called him
"cryin' Brian."

365
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,210
(Boone)
Hello, Peralta.

366
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,300
Aah!

367
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:55,518
You looking for something?

368
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,574
What is the deal with you

369
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,144
and this second-rate
pizza joint?

370
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,842
This place
is a Brooklyn institution,

371
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,411
and I'm here
because you think Sal did it

372
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:02,371
and you're wrong!

373
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,365
He did do it!

374
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,774
Sal was in financial trouble,

375
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,312
he has no alibi,

376
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:10,014
and in cases of arson,
the owner always did it.

377
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,246
What's going on, sir?

378
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,496
What's going on
is that Peralta

379
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,194
has screwed with me
for the last time,

380
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:15,475
and now he's gonna pay.

381
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,590
Oh, you know what, Boone?
Any time you want to...

[Grunts]

383
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,153

Get off him, Boone!
You big marshmallow!

Hey, break it up!
Now!

Hey, hey, hey!
Don't tell my guys what to do!

390
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,853
Don't tell me what
to tell people what to do!

391
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,294
Well, make me not do it,
tough guy.

392
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:38,544
Uh-oh.

[All grunting]

394
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,375
Hey, break it up!

395
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,259
I apologize, marshal Boone,

396
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,893
for Detective Peralta's
actions,

397
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:49,752
something I find myself
doing quite frequently.

398
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:51,225
In my defense,
I was the only one

399
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,859
saying we
should stop hitting.

400
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,781
Stop hitting them!

401
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,544
Kicking them will hurt more!

402
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,901
Okay, I'm a reasonable man,
so I'm just gonna say this.

403
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,080
Fire Peralta immediately.

404
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,329
He started a fight.

405
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:05,707
He overstepped
his jurisdiction.

406
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,525
And he's obsessed
with this pizza place.

407
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,040
What I'm obsessed with
is how you're bungling

408
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,258
this investigation.

409
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,282
They should
write a song about it

410
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:12,852
called welcome to the bungle.

411
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,038
Seriously, why are you

412
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,160
dragging Sal's pizza
through the mud?

413
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,121
That place is special.

414
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,724
Why's it special?

415
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:18,972
Because it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood!

416
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,126
Well...

417
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,087
According to Charles's
email blast,

418
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,049
it's actually number eight.

419
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,266
Captain reads my blast.

420
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,259
Of course,
it's the only one

421
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,381
that measures mouth-feel.

422
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:26,342
What, are you kidding
right now?

423
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,335
This isn't about pizza.

424
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,449
What's it actually about?

425
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:32,268
When I was a kid,
I was shortstop

426
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,357
on my little league team.

427
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,864
Oh, my God.

428
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,242
It's the truth.
It's not a brag.

429
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:38,421
My dad was the coach,
and after every game,

430
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:40,022
he would take the team
to Sal's.

431
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,586
Halfway through our last season,
he left me and my mom,

432
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,477
and the worst part about it
was that I couldn't

433
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:46,399
go with him
to Sal's anymore.

434
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,290
Well, that's certainly not

435
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,667
what I expected this
to be about.

that happened to you.

I mean,
what kind of dad just...

439

Just leaves his son
like that?

Look, you're...
You're a cop and...

441
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:05,719
And I'm a firefighter,
but underneath all of it,

442
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,468
we're just two boys
whose dads abandoned them.

443

solve this thing, together.

What's going on?

00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:35,676
Did you drive me out here
to kill me?

456
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,925
I thought about it,

457
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,367
but then I put
that thought on hold.

458

I wanted to show you

This is Ropesburg?

You wanted this offer
so badly,

a chance at the job.

Are you here to reconsider?

We've bought
the deputies bullets,

464
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:50,892

He quit to start
a carpet cleaning business,

than being Captain here

boring place on earth.

So of all the candidates

481
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,530
that you interviewed today,

482
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:21,779
who do you think
I should hire?

483
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:25,496
Well, the interviews
got a little off-track.

484
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,580
But I'd go with Simon Walker.

485
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,182
Computer science degree,
worked for the board of ed

486
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,143
for ten years.

487
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:31,265
That guy?
No way.

488
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,738
He yelled at me
when I asked him

489
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:35,109
the same question about Jay-Z
three times in a row.

490
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,359
Why does that matter?

491
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,089
Because whoever
takes this I.T. Job

492
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,499
is gonna have
to deal with Hitchcock

493
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,388
asking how to log in
to his email

494
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,374
every single day
forever.

495
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,137
How do you think
Professor short fuse

496
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,122
is gonna handle that?

497
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:47,797
Fine, what about this guy?

498
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,584
Mm, no.
He was scared of everything.

499
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:54,174
Do you remember Rosa's reaction
last time the printer jammed?

500
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,516
I'll pay for that.

501
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:03,111
Fine, what was with
the flossing?

502
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:06,186
Mm, a precinct is a pretty
gross place, ter-bear.

503
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:09,200
There's blood, wounds,
Scully's feet.

504
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,704
You need a strong stomach,

505
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,499
and that lady
did not have one.

506
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,998
Plus, we already have
the perfect candidate already:

507
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,409
Savant.

508
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,842
That punk who hacked us?

509
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,228
Precisely.

510
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,080
Captain,
turn your greatest weakness

511
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,361
into your greatest strength,

512
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,924
like Paris Hilton
re: Her sex tape.

513
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:26,853
Get to the point.

514
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,065
Savant tore our walls down,

515
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,018
but he can build them
back up,

516
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,036
taller and thicker
than ever.

517
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:35,103
But how can we be sure
he won't turn on us?

518
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,657
His mom ratted him out,

519
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,125
so I bet he'd love
a steady paycheck

520
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,921
to get out of
that snitch's house.

521
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:43,196
[Laughs]
If I had a mic right now,

522
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,556
I'd drop it.

523
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,640
There we have it.

524
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,261
And here's the file
you wanted.

525
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,722
Well, it's hard to believe
I'm gonna say this,

526
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,869
because I've spent most
of my adult life hating you

527
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,663
and everything
you stand for, but...

528
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:00,816
Thanks.

529
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,764
I'm not gonna lie,
my therapist

530
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:05,302
is gonna be
very proud of me.

531
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,617
That's weird.

532
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:07,706
Any reason you can think of
one of your guys

533
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:08,795
would've
forced this cabinet open

534
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:09,755
while they
were putting the fire out?

535
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,325
No, no.
I can't.

536
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,337
Looks like it was jimmied open
with a crowbar.

537
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,963
Oh, my God.
I know who did it.

538
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,886
Come on, I'll explain it
on the way down.

539
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:20,680
Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,219
I can't believe
I'm offering this to a cop,

541
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,077
but...

542
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,519
Do you want
to take the pole down?

543
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,048
Oh, my God, yes.

544
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,846
Whee!

545
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,639
Let justice be served.

546
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,177
- Did you get it?
- Uh-huh. My turn?

547
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,714
Nope. No time.

548
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,226
Whoo!

549
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,788
We know you burned down
Sal's, gino.

550
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,903
You hated him because his pizza
was better than yours.

551
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,504
That's not true.

552
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:49,882
Gino's pizza's
always been the tastiest.

553
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,164
Wrong.

554
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,382
According to Boyle's
email blast,

555
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,760
it was downright lousy before.

556
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:54,818
That's what made it
so suspicious

557
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,292
when he suddenly loved it.

558
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:59,207
[Distorted]
Much better than last time.

559
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,424
[Spits]

560
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,673
The crust was charred,

561
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,500
the cheese was stringy
and flavorless,

562
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,621
but the sauce.

563
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,992
Oh, Marone, the sauce.

564
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:07,984
Continue.

565
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,139
And that was your mistake.

566
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,387
You didn't
just burn Sal's down,

567
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,662
you also stole
his secret sauce recipe.

568
00:18:12,663 --> 00:18:14,456
Here's a picture

569
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:16,475
of the cabinet in which
said recipe was held.

570
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:17,831
Busted open with a crowbar.

571
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:19,358
Look familiar?

572
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,602
Also, your so-called
motivational speech

573
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,557
down at the prison
ended at 5:00 P.M.,

574
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,287
leaving you plenty of time
to get back to Sal's

575
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:26,729
and burn it to the ground.

576
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:29,228
So I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

577
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:31,246
(Both) Gino Bianucci,
you're under arrest...

578
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,754
- [Clears throat] Excuse me. No.
- Do you mind?

579
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,290
This is my collar...
I think I can handle this.

580
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,668
If I'm not wrong.

581
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,590
Yeah, but I actually
did all the work.

582
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:39,033
See, I knew you would...
You know what? Fine.

583
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,634
Go ahead, I don't care.

584
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:42,022
Gino Bianucci, you're
under arrest for arson. Yes!

585
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,005
- Said it first.
- Real mature.

586
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:44,255
Very mature.

587
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,729
Off we go.

588
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:49,349
So what'd you think
of Ropesburg?

589
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,265
It's, uh... quaint.

590
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,995
It's whack,
and you know it.

591
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:57,006
Their number-one crime
is tricycle theft.

592
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,704
There's a bakery
attached to the precinct.

593
00:18:58,705 --> 00:18:59,922
Come on, Santiago.

594
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,621
You never would've
taken that job,

595
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:03,511
so why'd you even care
that they offered it to me?

596
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:06,138
I can't help it.
I'm competitive.

597
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,350
I have seven brothers,
and I was the only girl.

598
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,400
I always had to fight
for a place at the table.

599
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,866
Well, you're not the only girl
at the table anymore.

600
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,108
We work in a police force
full of dudes.

601
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,568
We gotta have
each other's backs, okay?

602
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,176
You saying you have my back?

603
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,810
Yeah, I got your back.

604
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,123
Don't smile.
I'm still mad at you.

605
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,663
I thought we were
having a moment.

606
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,071
Moment's over.
Shut up.

607
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,197
(Hitchcock)
Hey, sarge.

608
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,980
He made my computer smarter.

609
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,903
All I have to do
is put my thumb on that thing,

610
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,601
and it opens up
all my electric mails.

611
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:35,837
[Laughs]
You seem real smart, man.

612
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,080
Oh, and look,
and you play with toys.

613
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,995
Savant, you're part
of the nine-nine now.

614
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,212
We look after each other.

615
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:43,238
Hey, ball,

616
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,256
if savant
was to do anything

617
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:47,983
to harm this precinct,
would I destroy him?

618
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,786
Answer uncertain.
Try again.

619
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,568
Peralta, fire marshal Boone
just called.

620
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,489
He told me you should
check your drawer?

621
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,681
Oh, look at that.

622
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,987
I've been booned.

623
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,204
Well, the joke's on him,

624
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,563
because I was out
of shaving cream.

625
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:11,500
I see we are once again at war
with the fire department.

626
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,850
You are not to retaliate.

627
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,310
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of it, sir.

628
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,076
In fact, I'm gonna send over
a little peace offering:

629
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:19,188
Some of Sal's famous sauce.

630
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:20,148
Now, Boyle!

631
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,396
[Alarm blares]

632
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,393
Fire! Fire! Fire!

633
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,998
Pleasure working
with you, Boone.

634
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,380
Run, Charles!

635
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:31,040
[Laughter]

636
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,197
Come on... whoa!
Get that guy!

637
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,985

Dryin' dishes, yeah.

00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,343
Man, Charles has been
so happy and confident

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:07,811
ever since he hooked up
with that Professor

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:09,112
at the Captain's party.

5
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:14,351
She has tenure,
and also has ten years,

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,886
times two, older than him.

7
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,321
That sucked.
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:19,589
It's nice to see him like this.

9
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:21,324
<i>He's so confident.</i>

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,226
This morning, he finally
corrected the barista

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,861
when she called him "Charlize."

12
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,731
He's been living as
"Charlize broil" for five years.

13
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,799
It's great.
It's all so great.

14
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,868
He could take it down,
just a smidge.

15
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:34,137

Sorry.

17
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:38,575
But whatever,
I can handle the singing.

18
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,809
I'm just so happy for that guy.

19
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:40,910
It's about time
he caught a break.

20
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:43,380
Sexy train is
leaving the station.

21
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:45,348
Check out this caboose.

22
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:46,816
Later, sluts.

23
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,851
Just let him have it.

24
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,819
Great job, Boyle.

Well--

Eyes up here, Gina.

32
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,186

Ooh.

Not bad, not bad.

An unlicensed cab driver's
been picking up tourists.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,194
Driverakeshe vics
down under the B.Q.E.,

37

robs 'em at gunpoint,
leaves them stranded.

38
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:34,798
Unfortunately, because
they're tourists,

39
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:36,733
and our perp is not Caucasian,

40
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,735
we don't have a clear idea
of what he looks like.

41
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:42,572
He was either Latino,
arabor mican.

42
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:45,909
Either way, very Muslim.

43

We'll go undercover,
dress as out-of-towners,

hope the perp picks us up.

Don't worry, sarge,
we'll nail this guy.

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,317
I can't believe I was just

47
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,885
briefly attracted to Boyle.

Ugh. Ugh!

A Mr. brain Jensen
here to see you, sir.

50
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:06,096
It's Brian.
Mm, not according to this note

51
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,099
I wrote on my hand
very quickly: "Brain."

52
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,968
Captain holt, we recently met
at the African-American

53
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,904
gay and lesbian New York City
policeman's association.

54
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,473
Uh, yes, that name
is quite a mouthful.

55
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,007
Just call it the "aaglnycpa."

56
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,742
Your organization has
meant so much to me.

57
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,611
Uh, well, it's not
my organization.

58
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,379
I mean, I did found it
and I've been president

59
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:26,449
for the last 25 years
and I oversee every detail,

60
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:29,018
but really,
it's our organization.

61
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:30,386
It's yours.

62
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,721
And out of respect for you
and everything

63
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,590
that you've done,
I wanted to stop by

64
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:35,325
and let you know I'll be
running for president.

65
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,127
I hate to run against you,

66
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,561
but I have some ideas
for change that'll

67
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:41,064
bring aaglnycpa
into the 21st century.

68
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,132
I see.

69
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,033
Well, it's been good
meeting you.

70
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,102
And, uh, I wish you
the very best.
Thank you.

71
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,570
Good-bye, brain.

72
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,272
It's--it's Brian.

73
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:50,607
Very nice man.

74
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,875
Yes, he is.

75
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,245
Now, let's figure out how to...

76
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,280
Destroy him.

77
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,549
How'd the interview
with the victim go?

78
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,717
It went okay.

79
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:02,051
The guy was from Canada,
said it was probably

80
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:03,319
his fault for getting robbed,

81
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:04,621
and apologized
for wasting my time.

82
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:05,989
Oh, Canada.

83
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,291
Truly odie to
America's garfield.
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:09,413
Hey, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

85
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,660
I think I can get us
some nets tickets.

86
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:11,895
No go, amigo.

87
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,931
Tomorrow is vivi's and
my big 20-day anniversary.

88
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,466
I'm pulling out all the stops.

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
Dinner at le bonbon,

90
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:18,868
with 300 roses at the table.

91
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,103
No. Oh, man.

92
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,972
Then a gondola ride
along the gowanus canal.

93
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:25,208
No. No, no, no, no, no.
And then, a skywriter's

94
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,310
gonna write,
"Charles loves v."

95
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,578
I couldn't afford
her full name.

96
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:30,480
Okay, first of all,
"Charles loves v"

97
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,048
means something very specific

98
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,716
and, I'm gonna guess,
not what you're intending.

99
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,719
But more importantly,
you're going full Boyle.

100
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:38,288
What? I am not.

101
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:40,223
What's full Boyle?
Anytime Charles gets

102
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:42,091
into a new relationship,
he gets way too intense

103
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:45,328
way too fast, and it always
ends in heartbreak.

104
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,629
We met on the subway,

105
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,364
went out to dinner,
and I told her ioveder.

106
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,433
And my mom was so happy.

107
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,236
And then the barbershop quartet
I hired started to sing.

108
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,305
And then she broke up with me.
And then she broke up with you.

109
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,573
Yes!

110
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:59,409
Oh, joanna, no!

111
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,577
Courtney!

112
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,778
Rhonda!

113
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,446
I know when
I'm going full Boyle.

114
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,814
Trust me, this is different.

115
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,049
I have it under control.

116
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,585
Gotta go, Jakey.

117
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,086
Excuse me.

118
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,688
Are you a Detective?

119
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,756
Oh, uh, who's asking?

120
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,958
I'm super Dan,

121
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:17,327
scourge of
Brooklyn's underworld,

122
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,762
and I need to talk
to an officer of the law.

123
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:23,032
I'm busy right now,
working on this... Excuse.

124
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,367
I think Santiago's free.

125
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,802
Hi.

126
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,537
I'm super Dan.

127
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,205
And I have a crime to report.

128
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,741
Oh, gosh, I am so sorry.

129
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:34,510
I literally just retired.

130
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,513
This is my retirement cake.
Mmm.

131
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,450
Thanks, you guys.
I'm gonna miss this place.

132
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,318
Why aren't you guys
taking me seriously?

133
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,787
Your cape and your tights,

134
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:45,888
and your name is super Dan,

135
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:47,557
and I can kinda see your penis.

136
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,792
And it's just all
a rich tapestry.

137
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:51,127
Yeah, well, I'm a citizen.

138
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,528
I'm from this neighborhood.

139
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:55,365
So the only reason
I'm wearing this costume

140
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,234
is so when I'm fighting crime, ,

141
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,936
people will respect
my authority.

142
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,237
How's that working out for you?

143
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,940
Detectives, when a citizen
comes in off the street,

144
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,442
it is NYPD policy
to take a statement.

145
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,345
This isn't enough
of a statement?

146
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,414
Yes, I wanted to inquire

147
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:13,016
about renting out
the statue of liberty

148
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,550
for a romantic evening.

149
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:15,685
Mm-hmm.

150
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,320
Is there a bed in the torch?

151
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:18,888
No? Okay.

152
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:19,989
I'll get back to you.

153
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,758
Hey there, Charles.

154
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,359
I thought maybe we should
have a little chat

155
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:24,794
about how crazy you're acting,

156
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,429
and how you're blowing this
beyond repair.

157
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,098
Are you really qualified
to give romantic advice?

158
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,968
You're not exactly the king
of mature relationships.

159
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:33,369
Fair enough.
But I would argue

160
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,505
that I am like
a beautiful angel of love,

161
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,206
who has trouble finding love
for himself.

162
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,474
Admit that you would
see that movie.

163
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,509
I would.

164
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:40,643
Thank you for honesty.

165
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,045
But this is not about me.

166
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,313
It's about Charles.

167
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,515
I've seen this before,
buddy, and it is bad.

168
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,483
Jake, I'm nowhere near
full Boyle.

169
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,452
Then prove it.
Just push your

170
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:50,987
anniversary dinner one night.

171
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,955
Say, "Vivian, tomorrow
doesn't work for me.

172
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,057
Can we reschedule?"

173
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:56,926
If this will convince you,
more than happy.

174
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,661
No problem.
Great.

175
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,196
Voice mail.

176
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,332
God, I love how she says
the words, "you've reached."

177
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,534
Hi, vivi. It's chucklebunny.
Oof.

178
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,504
I'm just calling
about dinner tomorrow.

179
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,572
I can't wait to see you,

180
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:10,907
my luscious little
breakfast quiche.

181
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,475
I just wanna
draw you a bubble bath

182
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,110
and spoon-feed you caviar.

183
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,845
I think we should open up
a joint checking account.

184
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,347
I love you--
what am I doing?

185
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,883
It's okay. I hung up
right after "chucklebunny."

186
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,886
Help me.
I've gone full Boyle.

187
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,376
I need to focus
on my reelection campaign.

188
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,744
Clear my schedule.

189
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,479
You really care about
this little club, huh?

190
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,681
It's not a club.
It's an organization

191
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:36,650
that I founded
over 25 years ago.

192
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:39,653
I'm proud to say we now
have 50 members.

193
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,722
But it wasn't so easy
in the beginning.

194
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,557
I'd like to request
discretionary funds,

195
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,559
to start an organization
supporting black

196
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,194
gay and lesbian
police officers.

197
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,736
They never actually said no,

198
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,638
so I just went ahead
and did it.

199
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:00,274
I've poured my heart and soul
into this organization.

200
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,910
And I'm not gonna just
give up the presidency.

201
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,212
You should make me
your campaign manager.

202
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,613
I was born for politics.

203
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,116
I have great hair
and I love lying.

204
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,852
Find out everything you can
about this Jensen.

205
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,253
I'll work on my speech.

206
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:16,023
How's this for an opening joke?

207
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:17,291
You know what
the toughest part about

208
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:20,294
being a gay black
police officer is?

209
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,396
The discrimination.

210
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,366
I believe that's what
you call observational humor.

211
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,702
Probably. That's great.

212
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:33,206
All right, let's go over
our disguise

213
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,043
I am Herbert goffleman
from San Diego.

214
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:37,311
I came here to stand
in the cold

215
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,845
outside <i>the today show,</i>
holding a sign

216
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,847
with a misspelled word on it.

217
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:42,149
Oh, you know what?
You win.

218
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,351
That neon green Fanny pack
screams, "gullible tourist."

219
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,552
It's mine.
I brought it from home.

220
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,220
Hey, can I have
my phone back, please?

221
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,089
Uh, no, because
you will call Vivian,

222
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:50,223
and you have the worst case

223
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,292
of full Boyle I've ever seen.
What?

224
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,627
I found this, by the way.

225
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,029
You wrote "Mr. Charles Ludley"
over a thousand times.

226
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:57,831
Why would you
take her last name, Boyle?

227
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:58,999
Look.

228
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,267
For the last two years,
I've been

229
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,035
directing all my love at rosa.

230
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,670
So my emotions just piled up.

231
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:04,972
And now with Vivian,
my feelings

232
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,740
are springing out of me
like a fire hose.

233
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:08,742
Oh, that is overtly sexual.

234
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:10,043
Jake, I'm gonna ruin it.

235
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:11,311
You gotta help me.

236
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,679
All right, here's the plan.

237
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:14,348
I'll text Vivian
from your phone,

238
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:16,316
and tell her you want it
to be a double date.

239
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,151
That way, I can come with you
and hold your hand.

240
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,219
Well, then your hand
will be on her butt,

241
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:20,260
because my hand
will be on her butt.

242
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:21,455
You gotta get it together, man.

243
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:23,357
I told you I need help!

244
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,058
Hey, can I get your file

245
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,693
on that Atlantic Avenue
drug ring?

246
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,528
Sarge gave me and Scully
the case.

247
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,664
What?
Oh!

248
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:31,732
Why did you do that?

249
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,867
I-I know I deserved it,
but why?

250
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:36,236
Sarge, you reassigned
our drug case?

251
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,939
Diaz and I have been
working it for three months.

252
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:40,107
Remember super Dan?

253
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,875
The guy you ignored
and made fun of?

254
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,744
He's been perching
on rooftops at night,

255
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,612
secretly taking photos
of drug deals.

256
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:47,681
He has thousands of images

257
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:49,916
and can I.D. The entire network
of dealers.

258
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,051
What?
But you refused

259
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,253
to take his statement,
because he had a cape on.

260
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,122
Luckily, Hitchcock
and Scully didn't mind.

261
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,857
I didn't even notice
he was wearing a cape.

262
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,759
You're a cop.
You should've noticed that.

263
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,595
We screwed up.
Message received.

264
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,929
Yep, be nicer to virgins.

265
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:04,464
She doesn't speak for me.

266
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:06,767
You're not getting
your case back.

267
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,235
Okay.

268
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,104
Here's what I found out
about our competition.

269
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:14,274
Brian Jensen, born 1899,

270
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:16,543
served in the Navy
during world war I.

271
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,745
A hero at the battle
of scimitar hill,

272
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,480
Jensen perished
in a factory fire

273
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,616
in the Netherlands.

274
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,384
This may be a different
Brian Jensen.

275
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,420
I've never been
in this position before.

276
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,321
I've always run unopposed.

277
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:30,824
If you wanna compete,
you're gonna have to have

278
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:33,427
a little more pizzazz.

279
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:35,162
A couple ideas for ya.

280
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:37,064
The obvious place to start
would be you,

281
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,398
in a silver suit,

282
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,834
with sunglasses
and roller skates--

283
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,303
the candidate of fun.

284
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,305
What's your second idea?
<i>Nada.</i>

285
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,008
Thought I had a slam dunk
on the first one.

286
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,045
Hi, there.

287
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,747
We'd like to go
to the Times Square.

288
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:55,549
We're brothers.

289
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,318
We're all set for
the double date tonight.

290
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:00,787
Vivian's bringing
her friend bernice.

291
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,155
Bernice?

292
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,024
That sounds like
a cartoon dump truck.

293
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,859
Whatever, that's probably
for the best.

294
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:07,327
I don't need any distractions.

295
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:08,762
My mission is to protect you.

296
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:09,996
All right.

297
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:11,231
Hey, this guy's going
the right way.

298
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,632
We should get out
and try again.

299
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,301
You can let us off here.

300
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,974
We would like
to buy some bagels.

301
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:22,743
And where is
the <i>sex and the city</i> street?

302
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:24,377
We wanna see
where Carrie and big live.

303
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,113
I'm a Carrie.
I think I'm a Carrie.

304
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,615
We're both carries.

305
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,717
All right, let's prepare
for the date tonight.

306
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,619
Here's the things you're not
allowed to talk about:

307
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:35,122
Love, poetry, music,
or passion.

308
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,823
We don't have to talk at all.

309
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:38,158
I'll just stare into her eyes.

310
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,060
They're like little drops
of cilantro reduction

311
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,795
on Lily-white flan.
Okay, no.

312
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,396
See, no food talk.

313
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:44,464
It sets off something primal

314
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,932
and disgusting in both of you.

315
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,300
It makes me wanna barf.

316
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,602
You're right.
Look, if you feel like

317
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:50,403
you can't handle it,
we need a signal.

318
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:51,471
I'll do this.

319
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,243
And how would you
do that naturally?

320
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,377
I don't know.

321
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,779
This guy's clean, by the way.

322
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,380
Can we pull over, please?

323
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:02,816
There she is.

324
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,184
I don't know if I can do this.

325
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:05,652
Listen to me.
I am with you all night.

326
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:06,953
And nothing will distract me

327
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,122
from my solemn vow
to protect you, okay?

328
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,223
Okay.

329
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,725
Vivian, you look beautiful.

330
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,260
I love your dress.
Aww.

331
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,595
You too, Charlie.
You look so handsome.

332
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,099
Steady, steady.

333
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,067
Jake, this is
my friend bernice.

334
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:24,237
Oh, hello.
I'm jak-tractive.

335
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,572
Jak-tractive?

336
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:30,544
Yes, my parents were hippies.

337
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,045
Let's eat.

338
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,604
Okay, so, Jake, you're a cop.

339
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,406
I wanted to be a cop
when I was a kid,

340
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,675
mostly because I love <i>die hard.</i>

341
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,645
<i>Die hard,</i> really?
Mm-hmm.

342
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,913
Well, that makes sense,
everyone loves that movie.

343
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,181
Oh, not like me.

344
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:49,018
I sleep in a nakatomi Plaza
security t-shirt.

345
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:50,853
Oh, no.

346
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,321
What kinda dogs do you like?

347
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,023
I mean, you know,
just hypothetically,

348
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,524
if we were to get a dog.

349
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:56,992
Oh, I love all dogs.

350
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:58,927
When I was a kid,
I had the cutest

351
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,196
golden retriever, named Rufus.

352
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,865
That is the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

353
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,233
I wanna meet him.

354
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,335
Charles, why don't you
tell Vivian

355
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,203
about the ten-day forecast?

356
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:09,471
Oh, good idea.

357
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,606
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

358
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,875
So if you're not a cop,
then what do you do?

359
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,076
I'm in grad school.

360
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,811
I thought about maybe
being a sports reporter,

361
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,380
but it would be impossible
for me to be objective.

362
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:20,115
I love the nets so much.

363
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,784
You're a nets fan?
I love the nets.

364
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,020
Oh, my God. This season
has been a disaster, right?
Yes.

365
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:27,256
And everybody blames it
onas kidd.
Yes.

366
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,091
But it's like,
at a certain point,

367
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,693
Billy king is the one
who put the team together.

368
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:31,694
Yes.

369
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:32,861
<i>Wow.</i>

370
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,963
I love rainy days.
My mother loves rainy days.

371
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:37,066
You should meet her.

372
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,200
Excuse me.

373
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:39,435
Our signal.

374
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:41,003
Uh, here's a question
for the group.

375
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:44,006
What is the longest funeral
you've ever attended?

376
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,474
Ladies first.

377
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,377

384
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,396
It was inspired
by the city of New York,

385
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,331
in that I stole it
from some kids

386
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,200
I saw dancing
on the subway station.

387

All of you, go home,
immediately.

388
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,238
I appreciate the effort,
Gina, but I can't risk

losing this election.

390
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,475
The aaglnycpa means too much.

391
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,943
Let me rehearse my speech.

392
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:23,879
Do you want a president
who struggled against all odds

393
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,714
to create
this great organization?

394
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,716
Or do you want a great nothing

395
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:31,086
who struggled against
nothing odds to create nhing

396
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,488
yikes.

397
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:35,090
The meeting is beginning.

398
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,458
The stakes are
very high for me.

399
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:37,826
I'm getting nervous.

400
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:42,598
My stomach is in flux.

401
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,333
You know, in the court
of Louis xi,

402
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,201
women would only eat consomme,
because

403
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,402
they were worried that

404
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:49,171
chewing would
give them wrinkles.

405
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,240
I love it when you talk broth.

406
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,041
Hey, Charles, remember that dog

407
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,309
we found on the train tracks?

408
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,512
Was it inside-out
or just very badly burned?

409
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:57,579
Inside-out.
Yeah, 'cause there were

410
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:58,647
things on the outside that

411
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,115
definitely should've been
on the inside.

412
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,283
Definition of inside-out.

413
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,185
<i>Bingo.</i>
<i>Uh, will you excuse us?</i>

414
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,387
Bernice and I are gonna
use the ladies' room.
Yeah.

415
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,624
Hurry back.
Oh, no.

416
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,259
Jake, I can't stop
looking at her butt.

417
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,194
Yeah, you are definitely
making her uncomfortable.

418
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,862
And this beautiful
basketball-loving

419
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,131
<i>die hard</i> fan is tearing down
my walls of defenses.

420
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,833
If we find out that
she is half-Jewish,

421
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,101
we are all doomed!

422
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,736
I know.
I borrowed the waiter's phone

423
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,404
when you weren't looking,
and bought me and Vivian

424
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:23,872
plane tickets to Rome.
What?

425
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,240
We leave in two hours.

426
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:27,042
Terrible itinerary,
connect through Vietnam.

427
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,710
All right, just go home.
Get out of here and regroup.

428
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:30,045
I'll take care of everything.

429
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,247
I'll tell 'em
it was an emergency.
Thank you.

430
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:33,248
Can you make it
a work emergency,

431
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:34,349
not a bathroom one?

432
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:35,450
I kinda wanna make IA.

433
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,654
Sarge, you made your point.

434
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:39,688
We messed up.

435
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,056
But this is a big case,
and Hitchcock

436
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,524
and Scully are gonna
screw it up.

437
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,859
I'm sure they can handle it.

438
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:46,261
They have a combined
50 years of experience.

439
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:47,930
This morning I found
Scully's gun

440
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,998
in the freezer,
in the frozen yogurt.

441
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,834
I think he was using it
as a spoon.

442
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:54,536
The truth is,
I had to give 'em the case.

443
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,271
You insulted super Dan.

444
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:58,473
He refuses to cooperate
with you.

445
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,741
We weren't that bad.

446
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,577
You told him his superpower
was being so embarrassing

447
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,478
that people
laughed themselves to death.

448
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,147
Yeah.

449
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:07,850
For those of you
who don't know me,

450
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:09,318
I'm officer Brian Jensen.

451
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,120
Listen to him talk.

452
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:13,288
He has no gravitas.

453
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,858
Do you know what gravitas
sounds like?

454
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,594
Greetings, all.

455
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:20,729
Details about this organization

456
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,165
should be included
in NYPD recruitment literature

457
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,867
and on the website.

458
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,902
He actually has
some good ideas.

459
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,338
Maybe you shouldn't be
so quick to dismiss him,

460
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,974
like you were with a certain
amazing dance troop.

461
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,342
He isn't fit to be president.

462
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,077
He hasn't spent
the last 25 years

463
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,745
fighting to build
this organization.

464
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,046
Right. Is that bad?

465
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:42,217
I thought you created
agla--naca--macapa

466
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,152
or whatever, so people like him

467
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,221
wouldn't have to go through
what you went through.

468
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,290
Isn't it a good thing
that Brian Jensen

469
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,059
didn't have to struggle
for 25 years

470
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:52,861
just to get up on this stage?

471
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:55,097
<i>Thank you all for your time.</i>

472
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,398
I hope you vote for me.

473
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:04,172
Greetings, all.

474
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,507
You know what
the toughest part about

475
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,243
being a gay black
police officer is?

476
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:09,511
The discrimination.

477
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,415
What?

478
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,817
At the very first meeting
of the aaglnycpa,

479
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,120
I was elected president
unanimously,

480
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:19,321
because I was the only member

481
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:20,856
and I voted for myself.

482
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,792
But after 25 years of struggle,

483
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,994
I am no longer the only member.

484
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,963
And lookorward
to casting my vote

485
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:29,264
for someone else.

486
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,033
That is why I withdraw my name

487
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:34,269
from consideration
as president.

488
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,438
<i>Congratulations, Brian.</i>

489
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:42,177
If you screw this up,
I will impeach you.

490
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,613
I wrote the bylaws,
so I know how to do it.

491
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,649
But I'm very happy for you.

492
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:50,686
But I will impeach you,
if necessary.

493
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,255
Anyways, Charles wanted me

494
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:55,123
to reiterate how sorry he is,

495
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,758
but he got an emergency call.

496
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,261
And that is plausible,
because we're detectives.

497
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:00,495
<i>Well, is it a tough case?</i>

498
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,464
'Cause Charlie was acting
so weird tonight.

499
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:05,634
Mm-hmm. Work has been
so stressful.

500
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:08,170
Speaking of, here is your coat.

501
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,538
I've gotta run.

502
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:10,939
If you wouldn't mind
using the back exit,

503
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:12,174
it'll be much safer.
Trust me.

504
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,110
I'm a cop. New York, right?

505
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:18,347
Charles, what are you
doing here?

506
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,015
I'm so close to getting you
out of this.

507
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:21,783
They're putting their coats on.
Funny story--

508
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,352
I was walking home
and I passed a pawn shop.

509
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,686
And then I went into a trance.

510
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,954
And now I have
this engagement ring.

511
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,689
No, Charles!
Well,

512
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,624
I'm gonna go ask Vivian
to marry me. Bye.

513
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,493
No, give me that.
Jake!

514
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:32,494
<i>Give that back.</i>

515
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:33,729
I'm doing this
for your own good.

516
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:35,597
You've gone full Boyle.
I'm helping you out.

517
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,199
Give me that ring,
or I'm gonna pepper spray you.

518
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:40,669
Pepper spray me,
I will pepper spray you!

519
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,038
Huh?
Mm.

520
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,039
No!

521
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,146
Aah!

522
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,582
Crap! Crap! Aah, crap!
Crap! Aw, crap!

523
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,542
Hey, buddy.

524
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,311
Got you that fancy coffee
you like.

525
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,445
Nah, I don't want it.

526
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,180
Ah, so expensive.

527
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:04,348
How you holding up?

528
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,916
Well, Jake, I've been better.

529
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,584
Right. Look, I'm sorry

530
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,420
I threw your ring
in that boiling pork water.

531
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,722
Yeah. I'm sorry
I pepper sprayed you.

532
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,290
I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.

533
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,959
It burned like hell, right?
Yeah.

534
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,026
Thank God for that soda.

535
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,433
Ahh, it's so sticky,
but it feels so good.

536
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,001
Ooh, cab.

537
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:27,237
After you.
Yes, sir.

538
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,607
What are you two
still doing here?

539
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,809
Isn't your shift over?

540
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,310
There's something we need
to take care of.

541
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,347
Oh, super Dan, over here.
Thanks for coming.

542
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,881
Great.

543
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,049
You two?

544
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,317
If you guys wanna
make fun of me,

545
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,820
just come down to pita paradise
like everyone else does.

546
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,221
We need your help.
Why?

547
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:45,522
What happened to Scully
and Hitchcock?

548
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,625
They're busy,
cleaning Hitchcock's ear.

549
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,662
Yeah. Did you witness
any of these men

550
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,030
selling narcotics?

551
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,999
This is so official.

552
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,668
Yeah, this guy, number three.

553
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,036
That's the mope we brought in.

554
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,904
Yeah, okay.

555
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,539
We're gonna need
to take your statement.

556
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,575
Spare no detail.
Really?

557
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,176
Mm-hmm.
Yeah!

558
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,213
Okay, um, all right.

559
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,482
Well, uh, I was driving
around my neighborhood

560
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,584
in the "danmobile,"
which is my bike.

561
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,986
I know what we did wrong.

562
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,921
Ah, should've
followed the rules,

563
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,190
but more importantly,
we're supposed

564
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,292
to help out everyone,
no matter what.

565
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,694
That's right.

566
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:25,462
Nice work on the arrest.

567
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,431
I got vaccinated that year,

568
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,233
but then I still got the flu.

569
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,201
Whoa.

570
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,736
Don't be bummed, man.

571
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,905
It's gonna be okay.
No, it isn't.

572
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,107
You can't be with me
every minute of every day.

573
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,009
I'm in love with this woman,
for real.

574
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,111
And I'm gonna go full Boyle
and scare her off.

575
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,280
No, we can figure this out,
all right?

576
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:44,915
I still got your phone,
so you're good there--

577
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:45,983
hey, hey, hey, hey.

578
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,718
I think we're gonna get robbed.

579
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:48,919
I need to pull over.

580
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,289
Flat tire.

581
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,557
Give me your wallets.

582
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,692
NYPD, you're under arrest
for armed robbery!

583
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,094
A little to the left, Charles.

584
00:19:57,128 --> 00:20:00,164
Yeah, I'm still not seeing great
because of the pepper spray.

585
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,368
Hey, cab driver's
in the interrogation room.

586
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,037
<i>You ready?</i>
<i>Let's do it.</i>

587
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,139
Oh, no, what's this?

588
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,275
What is this?

589
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,376
I checked your phone.

590
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,444
There were a hundred texts
from Vivian,

591
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,478
worried about you,

592
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,113
a selfie that
I can never unsee,

593
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,648
and dozens of voice mails.

594
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,584
<i>Hey, chucklebunny, it's me.</i>

595
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:21,618
<i>You disappeared last night.</i>

596
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,253
<i>And you were acting weird.</i>

597
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,222
<i>And I'm worried it's</i>
<i>because I'm moving too fast.</i>

598
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:26,990
<i>I really wanna see you.</i>

599
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,158
<i>And I know it's 3:00 A.M.,</i>

600
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,726
<i>but we should</i>
<i>feed each other falafel</i>

601
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,195
<i>in our underwear--</i>
<i>okay.</i>

602
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,530
I know it when I hear it.

603
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,798
She's full Boyle.

604
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,033
Full Boyle for Boyle.

605
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,501
I took the liberty
of texting her,

606
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,969
and telling her to
come meet you here.

607
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,338
I thought you might
wanna give her this,

608
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,340
or something
considerably nicer.

609
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,675
That is definitely
not platinum.

610
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,343
You really think
this is a good idea?

611
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,811
Buddy, I honestly don't know,

612
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,746
but you're definitely
not gonna scare her off.

613
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,748
I say do whatever
makes you happiest.

614
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,850
Jakey, you're the best.

615
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,318
Ahh.

616
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:56,320
Your body is trembling
like a leaf.

617
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:59,623
I'm so excited.

618
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,991
Yes!
Yes?

619
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,326
Yes!

620
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,660
Aww.

621
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,396
Charles is engaged.

622
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,699
You handled this
really well, peralta.

623
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,034
I take back what I said
about you being immature.

624
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,637
Oh, apology accepted,
fart monster.

625
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,672
Okay.

626
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,007
Ohh.
Oh, no.

627
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,242
Oh, boy.
Okay.

628
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,344
Yeah, this is turning into
a live sex show.

629
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:21,712
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, no.

630
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:22,980
I wasn't saying it
in a bad way.

631
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,214
Jake!
Yep.

632
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:27,451
Although they can't see us.

633
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:28,752
<i>- Jake!</i>
- Yep.

634
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:32,253

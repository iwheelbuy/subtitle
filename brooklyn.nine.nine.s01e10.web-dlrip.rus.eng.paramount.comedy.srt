1
00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:04,680
- Happy Turkey Day.
- Yes! Right out of the gate.

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:05,963
What?
What's going on?

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,758
We're playing Boyle Bingo,
Thanksgiving edition.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,125
Everyone filled out their cards with
possible Charles-related scenarios.

5
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:12,599
First to bingo
get 100 bucks.

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,647
I had "Boyle calls it 'Turkey Day'"
on the center square.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,174
"Boyle explains that they ate
lobsters at the first Thanksgiving."

8
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:21,964
They did. Back in that time,
they called lobsters "ocean bugs."

9
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:24,272
- And... I'll just mark it off for you.
- I think got the winning card here.

10
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,063
Boyle tells us that he played
Pocahontas in his third grade play.

11
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,346
All the girls were too big.

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,386
This is a fun one... "Boyle says,
'Gobble, gobble, gobble.'"

13
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:32,931
Well, now that I know
you want me to say that,

14
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:34,760
I'll just say it
with two gobbles.

15
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,779
Gobble, gobble...

16
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,793
Gobble. God, it just
sounds right that way.

17
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,108
Ugh. I don't like
this game.

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,353
Ha! "Boyle objects
to Boyle Bingo."

19
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:45,566
- Come on, guys.
- Boyle says, "Come on, guys."

20
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:46,849
That's two for Terry.

21
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:48,676
Well, guess what.
I can spoil your little game

22
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,818
by sitting over here quietly
all day and doing nothing.

23
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,570
Anybody have "Boyle falls
on the floor?"

24
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,622
- No one?
- That's a victory.

25
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,643
That's a victory for Boyle.
Boom!

26
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,437
Boyle says, "Boom!"

27
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:16,866
Season 1, Episode 10
"Thanksgiving"

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,313
Synced by P2Pfiend & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

29
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,476
Check it out, chair jockeys.

30
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:26,548
While you were busy tickling the ivories
on your computers, I was doing a bust.

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,280
Cocaine!

32
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:29,562
Thanks, Lucius.

33
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,806
He ran, I pursued.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,148
Whole thing turned into
an awesome car chase.

35
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,996
- Aah.
- NYPD!

36
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,089
Come on.
Move, move, move.

37
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:47,500
Hey there, criminal.
It's me, Johnny Law.

38
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,103
Well, at least
you're done early,

39
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:51,830
so you have time to go home and
change for my Thanksgiving dinner.

40
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:53,736
Ugh. Why do we have
to dress up for Thanksgiving.

41
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,633
I don't even
celebrate that stuff.

42
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,949
The whole holiday is
based on overeating.

43
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:59,290
We should be wearing
velvet track suits and diapers.

44
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:00,540
Jacket and tie.

45
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:02,689
Rosa's even wearing
her formal leather jacket.

46
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,100
It's the one without
any blood on it.

47
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,832
You're gonna dress up,
and you're gonna

48
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,467
give a toast about
what you're thankful for.

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,525
Start preparing.

50
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:10,418
Oh, I prefer not
to prepare for my toasts.

51
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:12,277
I just wing 'em
like scat jazz.

52
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,351
- Are we singing?
- No, no, no, no.

53
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:20,680
OK... That's nice.

54
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:23,214
You don't have to...

55
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,490
I'm not
dressing up for your party.

56
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,981
Damn it, Boyle.
You left the fridge open.

57
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,224
The door couldn't shut
because of your empty pizza box.

58
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,788
Pizza? Please. This is a butternut
squash and truffle butter flatbread.

59
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,124
Everything's spoiled.
My lunch is ruined.

60
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,641
My chicken, my potatoes,
my pasta, my meatballs,

61
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,367
ham, my yogurt.

62
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,409
- Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
- I love yogurt.

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,824
So this is your lunch
for, like, the month?

64
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:53,966
I need to eat 10,000 calories a day
to maintain muscle mass.

65
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,563
My wife made me all of this before
she left town with the kids.

66
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:58,263
That was everything
in my fridge.

67
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,763
- Scully.
- Hey-a, Sarge.

68
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:02,656
I know you got a secret stash
of food hidden somewhere.

69
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,906
- Oh, no.
- Where is it?

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,832
- No, I don't.
- Is it in your pockets?

71
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:06,953
Oh, come on.

72
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets.
Turn around.

73
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:11,050
Sarge. Sarge!

74
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,597
Go limp, Scully.

75
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,200
This is fun.

76
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,798
Release your sweets.

77
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,576
Can I help you,
Santiago?

78
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,654
Oh, Captain, didn't
expect to see you there.

79
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,004
In my office?

80
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,636
So, I just wanted
to make sure that

81
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:30,779
you knew about the Thanksgiving dinner
I'm hosting for the squad after work.

82
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,404
Yes, I received your "Save the date"
decorative gourd,

83
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,873
your ornamental cornucopia,

84
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:40,593
and this beautiful handcrafted card
of a turkey wearing a top hat.

85
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,671
- It's a pilgrim's hat.
- Where's the buckle, Santiago?

86
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:45,051
The buckle.

87
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,091
My husband's out of town for work,
so of course I will attend your dinner.

88
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,015
Cool. Whatever.

89
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,292
Yeah, don't worry about it,
either way.

90
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:55,305
It's not a big deal.

91
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,518
- Yes!
- Why so excited?

92
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,085
Did you make the cover of
"Hair Pulled Back" magazine?

93
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,489
The captain is coming
to my party.

94
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:07,337
I'm gonna give a toast, tell him how
thankful I am to have him in the precinct,

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,518
and officially ask him
to be my mentor.

96
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,692
Wait, are you only hosting dinner
because you wanna suck up to Holt?

97
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,188
Not cool. This was supposed
to be about friendship.

98
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,555
You said you were only coming to see if
my apartment was the reason I was single,

99
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:21,800
or if it was my personality,
like you suspected.

100
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,039
Yeah, but that was before I knew
I could get up on this high horse.

101
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,450
Love the view up here.

102
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,774
Clip clop, clip clop,
clip clop.

103
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,255
Same to you, Your Honor.

104
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,885
- Oh, what judge were you talking to?
- That was my mother.

105
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:36,391
You call your mom
"Your Honor"?

106
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,186
She's a federal judge
in the Ninth Circuit.

107
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,056
- What else would I call her?
- Yeah, okay.

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,804
Captain, paperwork is
all done on that drug bust.

109
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,980
- What else you got for me?
- Nothing. All open cases are assigned.

110
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,385
Come on, there's gotta be
something I can investigate.

111
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,732
No, there's nothing.

112
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,880
All right, well, when there's nothing,
there's nothing, you know? What can you...

113
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:53,452
Whoa!
Who did that?

114
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,466
Don't worry, sir. I will stay
here all night figuring this out.

115
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,038
I know what you're
up to here, Peralta.

116
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,730
Damn straight. I'm trying to catch
the mad paper scatterer.

117
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:03,500
You want an excuse to skip
Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner,

118
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,771
because for some reason,
you refuse

119
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,695
to celebrate this holiday
like a normal person.

120
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,748
Fine. You're right. I wanna do
what I do every year -

121
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,466
Sit at home, watch football,
and eat mayo nut spoonsies.

122
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:14,306
Those are spoonfuls of mayo,
sprinkled with peanuts.

123
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:15,455
That's revolting.

124
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,399
Maybe so, but it's what
I invented when I was six

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,586
because my mom was working,
so I had to make dinner for myself.

126
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,446
My sad story
trumps your insult.

127
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:22,825
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

128
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,299
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

129
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,486
Thank you, Boyle.

130
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,185
If a case opens up,
it's yours.

131
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:32,059
But if not, you will be at Santiago's
as a professional courtesy. Dismissed.

132
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:35,266
From what?
I thought we were just chatting.

133
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,959
We never chat anymore.

134
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,609
Oh, my God, Amy, that's so cool that
you still live with your grandmother.

135
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,368
I live alone.
This is my stuff.

136
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,080
- I like quilts.
- Stop. Each sentence is getting sadder.

137
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,948
It looks like you live
on the set of <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>.

138
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,513
Well, I gotta say, it's not as bad
as I thought it would be.

139
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:56,624
I mean, the football game's not on,
so I can still watch it later at home.

140
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,350
And it's kind of cool to visit a time
before electricity was invented.

141
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,305
I have to practice my toast.

142
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,294
- God, how long is that?
- Eight pages.

143
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:04,801
- Single-spaced?
- Double-sided.

144
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,147
- Santiago style.
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,039
Hey, excuse me.
Can we please eat?

146
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:10,573
My body is starting
to digest itself.

147
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,528
Terry needs nutrients.

148
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,292
No eating until
the captain gets here.

149
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,888
- Okay? Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

150
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,614
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving
at your house than with my sister.

151
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,442
"Things you find
a the beach."

152
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:24,276
- For "S", I had seagull.
- Good one, Diana!

153
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,509
- Ice cream break.
- Yay!

154
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,428
It's so pleasant and boring.

155
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,544
But, Holt, at your house,
surrounded by these idiots?

156
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:33,725
Guaranteed train wreck.
Thanks for the invite.

157
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,573
He's here! Okay, he's here, everybody.
Be cool.

158
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,113
Hitchcock, why do you
have your shirt off?

159
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:41,358
Can't spill food on your shirt
if you're not wearing one.

160
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,993
What...

161
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,264
- Captain Holt.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

162
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,220
Your apartment was
very easy to locate.

163
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:51,902
Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.

164
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,376
Weirdest conversation ever.

165
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,557
Nice work, you two.

166
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,835
Before we eat,
I'd like everyone

167
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:01,368
to go around and say what
they're thankful for this year.

168
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,389
Fine, I'll go first.

169
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,564
I am thankful that Thanksgiving
only comes once a year.

170
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:09,419
People stuff themselves,
and then at midnight they

171
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:12,626
run to appliance stores
and trample each other to death.

172
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,839
It's a garbage holiday.

173
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:18,846
I'm sorry, I just get emotional when
I talk about how bogus Thanksgiving is.

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,385
I'll just go.

175
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,240
- I actually prepared a little something.
- You did?

176
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,281
When I was a little girl,
playing cops and robbers...

177
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,382
Excuse me.

178
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,178
Please.
Continue, Santiago.

179
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,228
- Or I could wait.
- No waiting, just toasting.

180
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:31,898
I want you to toast.
Now I wanna eat toast.

181
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,046
- Give me some toast!
- OK, I'll be right there.

182
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,437
- I have to head back to the precinct.
- No. Why?

183
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:38,491
Someone stole $10,000
from the evidence lockup.

184
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,268
Yes!
Oh, awesome.

185
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,904
- Why is that awesome?
- It's a case.

186
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,571
You said I could
hop on any case that came up.

187
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,783
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

188
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,508
Have fun, you guys.
Let's roll!

189
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,164
You'd think that one place money
would be safe is a police station.

190
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,432
I hear that.

191
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,964
Remember when Santiago
called you beautiful?

192
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,734
Yes, that was odd.

193
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,070
We need to get this money
back, the exact bills,

194
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,311
so the commissioner's office
won't make our lives hell.

195
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:02,588
What is this?

196
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,224
Uh, this is Terry dancing.

197
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,956
People do the weirdest stuff
in the evidence lockup

198
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:07,269
when they think
no one's watching.

199
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,963
Fast forward, fast forward,
fast forward.

200
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:13,201
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
- Okay, so here's our money.

201
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,452
Fast forward.

202
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:17,242
Hold it,
hold it, go back.

203
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:19,487
There's our guy.
Got him.

204
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,477
Okay, we should start
by checking all the perps

205
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,056
that were released
from holding today.

206
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,260
- Good idea.
- And if's none of them,

207
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,759
we may miss Santiago's
altogether.

208
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,814
Thanksgiving is dead!

209
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,988
Santiago, can we please,
please just eat?

210
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,689
What if captain Holt
and Jake are coming back?

211
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,446
Hang on.
I have a toast.

212
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,194
I am thankful to have someone
in my life

213
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:42,651
who gives me a reason
to get out of bed every morning.

214
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:45,911
And I hope that my relationship
with this person

215
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:49,598
will only grow more intimate.

216
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,497
Who are you talking about?

217
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:55,216
Um, Hitchcock.

218
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,539
OK, enough is enough.
I'm eatin'.

219
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,702
What's in these?

220
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,401
Potatoes, butter,
a little milk.

221
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,614
Oh, and I ran out of salt,
so I used baking soda.

222
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,186
Why wouldn't you?

223
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,629
They're both white powders.

224
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:13,520
Of course they're
interchangeable.

225
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,059
Yeah.

226
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,810
There were two men
released from holding today

227
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:21,473
that were the right height and weight
to be our thief on the security footage.

228
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:23,268
Even if it is one of them,
how will we know?

229
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,109
Easy. The guy on the footage
was left-handed.

230
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,401
We just give all of our suspects
some made-up form to sign,

231
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,848
and see which hand they use.

232
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,104
All right, amigo.

233
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,081
Punch it.

234
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,963
Good. Did that.
Now punch it.

235
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:43,783
Uh-huh. Safety first.
Punch it!

236
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,571
Okay, see, now I just feel like
you're messing with...

237
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,837
- Anyone want seconds?
- Can't. I'm so stuffed.

238
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:56,555
- Amy, the toilet's overflowing.
- What? Ew!

239
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,256
Scully, what did you do?

240
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:01,077
- And the night gets worse better.
- I didn't do it.

241
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,841
Although, I understand
why you suspect me.

242
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,749
Well, then who clogged it?

243
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,333
So none of you ate anything?

244
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,386
Terry, you said
you ate the whole turkey.

245
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,572
Toilet.

246
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,830
I ate one string bean.
It tasted like fish vomit.

247
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,653
- That was it for me.
- But I'm a good cook.

248
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,833
You all ate those brownies
I brought in last week.

249
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,398
- I thought they were erasers.
- Charles said he loved them.

250
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,866
I'm a textbook people-pleaser.
I have a serious problem.

251
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,817
This was great though.
You must be so proud.

252
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,657
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.

253
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:38,511
Everybody go home. We're just...
We're done hanging out together.

254
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:41,561
I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go
to the bar, they serve food there.

255
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,803
- That's a great idea.
- Oh, look at that.

256
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,534
"Boyle saves Thanksgiving."

257
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:46,946
- Does it really say that?
- No.

258
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,126
But it does say,
"Boyle believes obvious lie."

259
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,761
Damn it.

260
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,268
So what's our strategy here?

261
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,416
I'm thinking maybe we could
do the whole thing in character.

262
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,307
I'll play
detective Bart Barley...

263
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,809
Tightly wound, hates
violence against animals.

264
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,052
And you're my partner,
Gerald Jimes...

265
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:03,684
A man who solved every crime,
but one...

266
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:06,782
- The murder of his wife.
- Peralta, take this seriously.

267
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:09,144
I am. As seriously
as you're taking the search

268
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,963
for the man
who killed Jane Jimes.

269
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,656
Your only clue?
He wore a yellow sweater.

270
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:17,534
You're considering it.
Let's get in there.

271
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,122
NYPD.

272
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,008
What's going on? I'm right
in the middle of carving turkey.

273
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,116
I'm vegetarian.
Eating meat is murder.

274
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,927
- I hate violence against animals.
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.

275
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,316
We overlooked our release form we were
supposed to have you sign. We apologize.

276
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,559
Yeah, he's really right-handed.
Let's go.

277
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:36,809
♪ Look out, bad guys

278
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,508
♪ it's Barley and Jimes

279
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,914
♪ Barley and Jimes
are on the case ♪

280
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:43,513
Please refrain
from make believe this time.

281
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:45,541
Fine.

282
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,996
Evening, ma'am. NYPD.
Barley and Jimes.

283
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,363
- We're looking for Donny Romano.
- Ugh. Come in.

284
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:55,441
Donny, what'd you do?
Cops are here.

285
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,601
What do you guys want?

286
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,156
Sorry to bother you, sir,
my partner here

287
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,717
forgot about a form
we need you to sign.

288
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,581
What's happening, Donny?
What'd you do?

289
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:05,816
I didn't do anything.
It's not my fault.

290
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:08,344
- Same old story. It's never you, is it?
- What did Donny do?

291
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:10,171
I swear, ma, I don't know
what this is about.

292
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,121
- Why won't you ever believe me?
- 'Cause I raised a liar.

293
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:15,077
- You lie.
- Shut up, ma.

294
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,329
Hey, don't
talk to ma like that.

295
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,253
Don't you tell me
what to do, Louie!

296
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:19,438
Excuse me.

297
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,400
- Hey!
- Not the rolls!

298
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,619
George, do something.

299
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,254
Excuse me, if...

300
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:26,045
You know,
you're gonna get hurt.

301
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,263
- Get off now.
- Get off.

302
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,893
My wife was murdered by a man
in a yellow sweater!

303
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:33,619
It's the one case
I can't solve.

304
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,452
Don't fight with family.

305
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,807
It can all go away
so quickly.

306
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,443
Sign this?

307
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:48,237
That's a hell of a breakthrough,
Jimes. I'm proud of you.

308
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,380
Also, we just
caught our man.

309
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:54,073
- He signed with his right hand.
- That's right, he did.

310
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,451
But he didn't do it.

311
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:56,990
- He did.
- What?

312
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,653
Couldn't help but notice you throwing
those rolls with your left hand, boss.

313
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:02,779
Not mention, this hoodie matches
our security footage exactly.

314
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,560
You stole that money
when you came in to pick up

315
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,100
your brother from holding
today, didn't you?

316
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,024
- Damn it.
- Nice work, Peralta.

317
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,429
- So where's the money now?
- It's not here, all right?

318
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:11,423
I bet it all
on the football game.

319
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:12,802
- My bookie has it.
- Yes!

320
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,924
The case continues.

321
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:17,164
- This is not good.
- Right. Sorry, Jimes.

322
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,985
His father was murdered
by a bookie.

323
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,941
I know you miss him.

324
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:27,818
Our perp says the bookie operates
out of a hidden back room.

325
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:30,034
- Try to blend in.
- Good idea.

326
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:33,405
I'll just age myself 60 years,
become Chinese and female.

327
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,169
Here we go. Whoosh.

328
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,104
- Did it work?
- $10 to play.

329
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:40,409
- Oh, we're just looking around.
- $40 just to look around.

330
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,039
- All right, we'll play.
- $15 to play.

331
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,418
All right.

332
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:49,004
- Tommy, can we order some food?
- The cook's gone. I sent him home.

333
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,304
- Do you have any more of these pretzels?
- Sure.

334
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,199
- I'm gonna call the cook.
- Smart. Good call.

335
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,077
Hey, rough night?

336
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,091
Yeah, it certainly hasn't
gone according to plan.

337
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,535
Aw, no. Aw, Amy,

338
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,778
I was ordering a drink
called "A Rough Night."

339
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:09,279
It's tequila
with a nicotine patch.

340
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,980
Right.

341
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,127
How do I get Holt
to pay attention to me?

342
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,180
He sure spends a lot
of time on Peralta.

343
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,099
Maybe I should start
screwing up, like Jake does.

344
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,824
- I can act out too, you know?
- Please do.

345
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:23,326
Okay. Watch this.

346
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:29,707
Oops.

347
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,145
Out...
All of you.

348
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,326
- But the cook is coming back.
- Out!

349
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,705
Fine!

350
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,616
But I'm taking these olives.

351
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,606
Sorry.
Happy Turkey Day.

352
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,091
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

353
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:55,425
These tiles are either
game pieces or candy.

354
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,686
Game pieces. Here we go.

355
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,605
I think I just won.

356
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:05,579
The guy by the bathroom seems very
interested in the commotion you just made.

357
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:08,048
Yeah, and he's been waiting
for the toilet since we got here.

358
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,292
Ten-to-one that's not a bathroom,
and he's a lookout.

359
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,437
- Let's go.
- You got it.

360
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,493
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.

361
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:22,356
- There is nothing here.
- Don't worry, guys, I found food.

362
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,717
Are you eating
packing peanuts?

363
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,770
Okay, I do keep a secret stash
of food in the office.

364
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,626
I knew it!
Where?

365
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,105
Where?

366
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,247
- Sarge, am I too heavy?
- No. Where is it?

367
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,940
- There, the one with the water stain.
- There's a lot of food up there?

368
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:39,474
Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.

369
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,352
- I think the rats got to it.
- You think?

370
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:51,180
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened.

371
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,527
Okay, it's over.

372
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,321
Now.

373
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:56,899
No, this will not
be our Thanksgiving.

374
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,407
All right,
you all wait here.

375
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,843
Give me an hour.
Terry, to the door.

376
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,158
I'm just gonna
put you down, man.

377
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,333
Yeah, totally. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

378
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,847
Hey, there.
Bathroom?

379
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,628
There's another one upstairs,
over there.

380
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,083
Oh. Never mind.
Let's go.

381
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,815
- What, it's really a bathroom?
- No, no, no.

382
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,802
There's tons of illegal stuff
happening in there.

383
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:21,239
But they're watching the football
game and I DVR'd it.

384
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,337
- I don't wanna see the score.
- What?

385
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:25,364
Okay, fine.
We'll go get the stolen money.

386
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,550
NYPD. Freeze.

387
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,090
Change the channel
and then freeze.

388
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:30,655
Put it down!

389
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:31,938
Put it down,
put it down.

390
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,504
This is a weird request, but
will you switch places with me?

391
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,023
I really don't wanna
see the score.

392
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,188
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
That's so much better. Oh!

393
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:47,171
Why are there
so many TVs in here?

394
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,357
Thank you.

395
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,051
The money was still in the bookie's safe.
All the numbers match.

396
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,938
- Let's head back to Santiago's party.
- Ah, no thanks.

397
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,113
I think I'm gonna head home
and watch the football game,

398
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,083
which was ruined for me!

399
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,807
What's your problem
with celebrating Thanksgiving?

400
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,998
It's a sucky holiday.
It's always sucked.

401
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,429
My mom worked. My dad was gone.
And I sat at home, watching football.

402
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,032
Look, Jake.

403
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:09,310
I came from
a very formal family.

404
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,650
My parents were not
especially affectionate.

405
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,955
Really? "Your Honor"
wasn't a big snuggler?

406
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:17,392
But the beauty of being an adult
is that you can make a new family

407
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,132
with new traditions.

408
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,762
Well, that's nice, captain, but
I don't have a new family yet,

409
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:25,119
so I guess I'm stuck with
my awesome old traditions.

410
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,812
Okay. I'll tell the squad
you couldn't make it.

411
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,902
Thank you.

412
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,793
Before you go,
can I borrow some money?

413
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:33,038
I'm getting some pretty serious
vibes from Wendy over there,

414
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,797
and I'd like to take her
someplace special.

415
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,044
Hey. What are y'all
doing here?

416
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:45,289
Amy broke everything and
got us kicked out of the bar.

417
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,240
Then we got attacked by rats.
It's the best Thanksgiving ever.

418
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:50,030
Fascinating.

419
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:53,019
Happy Turkey Day.
Right through there, gentlemen.

420
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,332
Not a lot of places
are open,

421
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,604
so this will be a multiethnic,
nontraditional Thanksgiving.

422
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,610
It's a real culinary challenge.
Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.

423
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:01,691
Make it five.

424
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,856
You eat with your eyes,
so the plating alone...

425
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,198
Five, Boyle!

426
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:10,782
- Captain?
- Hm?

427
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,065
I wanna tell you something.

428
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,373
I think you're...

429
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,201
Like, when I was
a little girl...

430
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,670
You think I'm like
when you were a little girl?

431
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:22,029
- Forget it. The moment's passed.
- Is this about your toast?

432
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:25,108
- How'd you get that?
- Gina gave it to me.

433
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,359
It's very well-written.

434
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:29,914
There are several compelling anecdotes.
The fonts suit the tone.

435
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:31,260
Good work.

436
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,177
I do feel, however, the word choice
could've been improved in spots.

437
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:39,057
I marked them "Awk"
for "Awkward."

438
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,299
That was the best thing
anyone's ever said to me.

439
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,288
"I marked them 'Awk'
for 'Awkward'?"

440
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,003
It's advice.
He's mentoring me.

441
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:51,990
Yes!

442
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:55,623
So this is kind of a play on your
typical Thanksgiving dinner.

443
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:59,473
For turkey, we have the Peking duck
with a veggie samosa stuffing.

444
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,898
The potatoes are the empanadas
with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy.

445
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:06,462
And for dessert,
some seasonal gelatin cups.

446
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,680
Okay, I ran out of money.

447
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,188
They're from when Hitchcock
got his colonoscopy.

448
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:10,695
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

449
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:11,881
I'm here, I'm here.

450
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,184
Finally something
to actually be thankful for.

451
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:17,782
- What are you wearing?
- Santiago said to dress up, so...

452
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,385
Well, you look beautiful.

453
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,213
That's my thing now.
I'm just owning it.

454
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,362
Okay. Before we eat...

455
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,766
- Nope, not doing that again. Move.
- Could you pass the, uh...

456
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,994
You get that hand near me again,
you're gonna lose it.

457
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:30,526
Okey-doke, let's eat.

458
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:32,854
Hey, thanks for giving a copy
of my toast to Holt.

459
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,682
- That was nice of you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

460
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,734
I mean, you don't have to get
so freaked out around him.

461
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,864
You were just trying
to tell him you respect him.

462
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:40,294
Okay.

463
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,765
But, to be honest, I kinda
gave it to him as a prank,

464
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,041
'cause I thought it would be
super embarrassing for you.

465
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,318
But I'm happy it worked out.

466
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:50,050
But I would've been happy
if you hated it.

467
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,055
But I'm happy you didn't.

468
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:55,271
So, you pretty much got
the disaster night you were hoping for?

469
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,506
Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving
meal I've ever had and ruined it.

470
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:05,288
Excuse me! Uh, so, earlier at Amy's,
I didn't give a real toast because...

471
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,676
I didn't know what to say.

472
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,623
But, since that time,

473
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:12,098
a wise, unsmiling man
named Gerald Jimes

474
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:14,043
made me realize
what I <i>am</i> thankful for.

475
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,827
So, I'd just like to say
I'm happy to be here...

476
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,393
With my family.

477
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,168
My super-weird family,
with two black dads and...

478
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:26,601
Two Latina daughters
and two white sons and...

479
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,779
Gina, and...

480
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:32,138
I don't know what you are...
Some strange giant baby?

481
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,982
- To the Nine-Nine!
- To the Nine-Nine!

482
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:36,493
That was perfect.

483
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,629
Uh, Boyle cries!
I got Boyle Bingo!

484
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,576
- No...
- Yeah!

485
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,746

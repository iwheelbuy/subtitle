1
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:04,254
- Happy Turkey Day.
- Yes! Right out of the gate.

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:05,589
What?
What's going on?

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,457
We're playing Boyle Bingo,
Thanksgiving edition.

4
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:10,960
Everyone filled out their cards with
possible Charles-related scenarios.

5
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,495
First to bingo
get 100 bucks.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,666
I had "Boyle calls it 'Turkey Day'"
on the center square.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,336
"Boyle explains that they ate
lobsters at the first Thanksgiving."

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,238
They did. Back in that time,
they called lobsters "ocean bugs."

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,641
- And... I'll just mark it off for you.
- I think got the winning card here.

10
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:27,544
Boyle tells us that he played
Pocahontas in his third grade play.

11
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:28,879
All the girls were too big.

12
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:32,042
This is a fun one... "Boyle says,
'Gobble, gobble, gobble.'"

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,650
Well, now that I know
you want me to say that,

14
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,552
I'll just say it
with two gobbles.

15
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,654
Gobble, gobble...

16
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,790
Gobble. God, it just
sounds right that way.

17
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:42,158
Ugh. I don't like
this game.

18
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,494
Ha! "Boyle objects
to Boyle Bingo."

19
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,796
- Come on, guys.
- Boyle says, "Come on, guys."

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,131
That's two for Terry.

21
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,033
Well, guess what.
I can spoil your little game

22
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,302
by sitting over here quietly
all day and doing nothing.

23
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,206
Anybody have "Boyle falls
on the floor?"

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,341
- No one?
- That's a victory.

25
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,443
That's a victory for Boyle.
Boom!

26
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,311
Boyle says, "Boom!"

27
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:19,364
Season 1, Episode 10
"Thanksgiving"

Synced by P2Pfiend & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

29
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,201
Check it out, chair jockeys.

30
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:29,438
While you were busy tickling the ivories
on your computers, I was doing a bust.

31
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,240
Cocaine!

32
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:32,574
Thanks, Lucius.

33
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,910
He ran, I pursued.

34
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:37,346
Whole thing turned into
an awesome car chase.

35
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,350
- Aah.
- NYPD!

36
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,690
Come on.
Move, move, move.

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,239
Hey there, criminal.
It's me, Johnny Law.

38
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:52,907
Well, at least
you're done early,

39
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:55,744
so you have time to go home and
change for my Thanksgiving dinner.

40
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:57,727
Ugh. Why do we have
to dress up for Thanksgiving.

41
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:59,702
I don't even
celebrate that stuff.

42
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:01,071
The whole holiday is
based on overeating.

43
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,506
We should be wearing
velvet track suits and diapers.

44
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,808
Jacket and tie.

45
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,043
Rosa's even wearing
her formal leather jacket.

46
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:08,511
It's the one without
any blood on it.

47
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,313
You're gonna dress up,
and you're gonna

48
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,015
give a toast about
what you're thankful for.

49
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,116
Start preparing.

50
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:15,085
Oh, I prefer not
to prepare for my toasts.

51
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,020
I just wing 'em
like scat jazz.

52
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,258
- Are we singing?
- No, no, no, no.

53
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,763
OK... That's nice.

54
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,399
You don't have to...

55
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,768
I'm not
dressing up for your party.

56
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:35,440
Damn it, Boyle.
You left the fridge open.

57
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,775
The door couldn't shut
because of your empty pizza box.

58
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:41,482
Pizza? Please. This is a butternut
squash and truffle butter flatbread.

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,914
Everything's spoiled.
My lunch is ruined.

60
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,654
My chicken, my potatoes,
my pasta, my meatballs,

61
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:52,490
ham, my yogurt.

62
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:54,616
- Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
- I love yogurt.

63
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:57,128
So this is your lunch
for, like, the month?

64
00:02:57,162 --> 00:03:00,397
I need to eat 10,000 calories a day
to maintain muscle mass.

65
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,099
My wife made me all of this before
she left town with the kids.

66
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,868
That was everything
in my fridge.

67
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,470
- Scully.
- Hey-a, Sarge.

68
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,439
I know you got a secret stash
of food hidden somewhere.

69
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:10,740
- Oh, no.
- Where is it?

70
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,743
- No, I don't.
- Is it in your pockets?

71
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:13,911
Oh, come on.

72
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,279
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets.
Turn around.

73
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,173
Sarge. Sarge!

74
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:19,783
Go limp, Scully.

75
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,451
This is fun.

76
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:24,154
Release your sweets.

77
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,125
Can I help you,
Santiago?

78
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,328
Oh, Captain, didn't
expect to see you there.

79
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:33,733
In my office?

80
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,431
So, I just wanted
to make sure that

81
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:38,702
you knew about the Thanksgiving dinner
I'm hosting for the squad after work.

82
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:42,473
Yes, I received your "Save the date"
decorative gourd,

83
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:45,042
your ornamental cornucopia,

84
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:48,912
and this beautiful handcrafted card
of a turkey wearing a top hat.

85
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:52,116
- It's a pilgrim's hat.
- Where's the buckle, Santiago?

86
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,551
The buckle.

87
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:57,755
My husband's out of town for work,
so of course I will attend your dinner.

88
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,757
Cool. Whatever.

89
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,126
Yeah, don't worry about it,
either way.

90
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:04,221
It's not a big deal.

91
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,563
- Yes!
- Why so excited?

92
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,235
Did you make the cover of
"Hair Pulled Back" magazine?

93
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,736
The captain is coming
to my party.

94
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:16,740
I'm gonna give a toast, tell him how
thankful I am to have him in the precinct,

95
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:19,009
and officially ask him
to be my mentor.

96
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,312
Wait, are you only hosting dinner
because you wanna suck up to Holt?

97
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:25,949
Not cool. This was supposed
to be about friendship.

98
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:29,453
You said you were only coming to see if
my apartment was the reason I was single,

99
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,789
or if it was my personality,
like you suspected.

100
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:35,159
Yeah, but that was before I knew
I could get up on this high horse.

101
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,627
Love the view up here.

102
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:40,085
Clip clop, clip clop,
clip clop.

103
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,667
Same to you, Your Honor.

104
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:45,403
- Oh, what judge were you talking to?
- That was my mother.

105
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:46,971
You call your mom
"Your Honor"?

106
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,839
She's a federal judge
in the Ninth Circuit.

107
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:50,784
- What else would I call her?
- Yeah, okay.

108
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,644
Captain, paperwork is
all done on that drug bust.

109
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,948
- What else you got for me?
- Nothing. All open cases are assigned.

110
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,451
Come on, there's gotta be
something I can investigate.

111
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,852
No, there's nothing.

112
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,087
All right, well, when there's nothing,
there's nothing, you know? What can you...

113
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:04,722
Whoa!
Who did that?

114
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,859
Don't worry, sir. I will stay
here all night figuring this out.

115
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,494
I know what you're
up to here, Peralta.

116
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:12,296
Damn straight. I'm trying to catch
the mad paper scatterer.

117
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,178
You want an excuse to skip
Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner,

118
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,500
because for some reason,
you refuse

119
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,502
to celebrate this holiday
like a normal person.

120
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,638
Fine. You're right. I wanna do
what I do every year -

121
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:23,466
Sit at home, watch football,
and eat mayo nut spoonsies.

122
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,421
Those are spoonfuls of mayo,
sprinkled with peanuts.

123
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,617
That's revolting.

124
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,639
Maybe so, but it's what
I invented when I was six

125
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,915
because my mom was working,
so I had to make dinner for myself.

126
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,850
My sad story
trumps your insult.

127
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:35,285
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

128
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,820
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

129
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:38,054
Thank you, Boyle.

130
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,822
If a case opens up,
it's yours.

131
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:44,894
But if not, you will be at Santiago's
as a professional courtesy. Dismissed.

132
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,230
From what?
I thought we were just chatting.

133
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,033
We never chat anymore.

134
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,871
Oh, my God, Amy, that's so cool that
you still live with your grandmother.

135
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:58,741
I live alone.
This is my stuff.

136
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:02,604
- I like quilts.
- Stop. Each sentence is getting sadder.

137
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:04,547
It looks like you live
on the set of <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>.

138
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,216
Well, I gotta say, it's not as bad
as I thought it would be.

139
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,453
I mean, the football game's not on,
so I can still watch it later at home.

140
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,289
And it's kind of cool to visit a time
before electricity was invented.

141
00:06:13,324 --> 00:06:15,324
I have to practice my toast.

142
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,393
- God, how long is that?
- Eight pages.

143
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,961
- Single-spaced?
- Double-sided.

144
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,362
- Santiago style.
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,331
Hey, excuse me.
Can we please eat?

146
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,967
My body is starting
to digest itself.

147
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,002
Terry needs nutrients.

148
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,837
No eating until
the captain gets here.

149
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:31,538
- Okay? Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

150
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,375
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving
at your house than with my sister.

151
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,277
"Things you find
a the beach."

152
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:39,226
- For "S", I had seagull.
- Good one, Diana!

153
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:41,549
- Ice cream break.
- Yay!

154
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,586
It's so pleasant and boring.

155
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,788
But, Holt, at your house,
surrounded by these idiots?

156
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,057
Guaranteed train wreck.
Thanks for the invite.

157
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,061
He's here! Okay, he's here, everybody.
Be cool.

158
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,663
Hitchcock, why do you
have your shirt off?

159
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,999
Can't spill food on your shirt
if you're not wearing one.

160
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,701
What...

161
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,104
- Captain Holt.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

162
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,139
Your apartment was
very easy to locate.

163
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,970
Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.

164
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,545
Weirdest conversation ever.

165
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,814
Nice work, you two.

166
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,184
Before we eat,
I'd like everyone

167
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,820
to go around and say what
they're thankful for this year.

168
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,923
Fine, I'll go first.

169
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:23,227
I am thankful that Thanksgiving
only comes once a year.

170
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:26,197
People stuff themselves,
and then at midnight they

171
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:29,534
run to appliance stores
and trample each other to death.

172
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:31,836
It's a garbage holiday.

173
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,006
I'm sorry, I just get emotional when
I talk about how bogus Thanksgiving is.

174
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,607
I'll just go.

175
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:40,577
- I actually prepared a little something.
- You did?

176
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,702
When I was a little girl,
playing cops and robbers...

177
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,847
Excuse me.

178
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,715
Please.
Continue, Santiago.

179
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,848
- Or I could wait.
- No waiting, just toasting.

180
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,586
I want you to toast.
Now I wanna eat toast.

181
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,821
- Give me some toast!
- OK, I'll be right there.

182
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,310
- I have to head back to the precinct.
- No. Why?

183
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,446
Someone stole $10,000
from the evidence lockup.

184
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,295
Yes!
Oh, awesome.

185
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,997
- Why is that awesome?
- It's a case.

186
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,732
You said I could
hop on any case that came up.

187
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,034
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

188
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,870
Have fun, you guys.
Let's roll!

189
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,673
You'd think that one place money
would be safe is a police station.

190
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,992
I hear that.

191
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,587
Remember when Santiago
called you beautiful?

192
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:15,428
Yes, that was odd.

193
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,858
We need to get this money
back, the exact bills,

194
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,191
so the commissioner's office
won't make our lives hell.

195
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,519
What is this?

196
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,221
Uh, this is Terry dancing.

197
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,023
People do the weirdest stuff
in the evidence lockup

198
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,390
when they think
no one's watching.

199
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:29,193
Fast forward, fast forward,
fast forward.

200
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:32,563
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
- Okay, so here's our money.

201
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:33,864
Fast forward.

202
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,767
Hold it,
hold it, go back.

203
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,103
There's our guy.
Got him.

204
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:41,173
Okay, we should start
by checking all the perps

205
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,816
that were released
from holding today.

206
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,110
- Good idea.
- And if's none of them,

207
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,710
we may miss Santiago's
altogether.

208
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,848
Thanksgiving is dead!

209
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:53,151
Santiago, can we please,
please just eat?

210
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:54,920
What if captain Holt
and Jake are coming back?

211
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,789
Hang on.
I have a toast.

212
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,648
I am thankful to have someone
in my life

213
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,205
who gives me a reason
to get out of bed every morning.

214
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:06,597
And I hope that my relationship
with this person

215
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,434
will only grow more intimate.

216
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,409
Who are you talking about?

217
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,279
Um, Hitchcock.

218
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,777
OK, enough is enough.
I'm eatin'.

219
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,149
What's in these?

220
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,917
Potatoes, butter,
a little milk.

221
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,220
Oh, and I ran out of salt,
so I used baking soda.

222
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:31,855
Why wouldn't you?

223
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,356
They're both white powders.

224
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,325
Of course they're
interchangeable.

225
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,926
Yeah.

226
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:40,829
There were two men
released from holding today

227
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,599
that were the right height and weight
to be our thief on the security footage.

228
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,467
Even if it is one of them,
how will we know?

229
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,383
Easy. The guy on the footage
was left-handed.

230
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,767
We just give all of our suspects
some made-up form to sign,

231
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,273
and see which hand they use.

232
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,621
All right, amigo.

233
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,678
Punch it.

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,798
Good. Did that.
Now punch it.

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,813
Uh-huh. Safety first.
Punch it!

236
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:11,795
Okay, see, now I just feel like
you're messing with...

237
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,233
- Anyone want seconds?
- Can't. I'm so stuffed.

238
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:20,103
- Amy, the toilet's overflowing.
- What? Ew!

239
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:21,872
Scully, what did you do?

240
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,808
- And the night gets worse better.
- I didn't do it.

241
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,643
Although, I understand
why you suspect me.

242
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,628
Well, then who clogged it?

243
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,520
So none of you ate anything?

244
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,656
Terry, you said
you ate the whole turkey.

245
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,890
Toilet.

246
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:45,361
I ate one string bean.
It tasted like fish vomit.

247
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,297
- That was it for me.
- But I'm a good cook.

248
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,566
You all ate those brownies
I brought in last week.

249
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,235
- I thought they were erasers.
- Charles said he loved them.

250
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,804
I'm a textbook people-pleaser.
I have a serious problem.

251
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,874
This was great though.
You must be so proud.

252
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,788
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.

253
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,758
Everybody go home. We're just...
We're done hanging out together.

254
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,931
I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go
to the bar, they serve food there.

255
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,264
- That's a great idea.
- Oh, look at that.

256
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:11,065
"Boyle saves Thanksgiving."

257
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,534
- Does it really say that?
- No.

258
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,803
But it does say,
"Boyle believes obvious lie."

259
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,504
Damn it.

260
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:18,072
So what's our strategy here?

261
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:20,307
I'm thinking maybe we could
do the whole thing in character.

262
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,275
I'll play
detective Bart Barley...

263
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,878
Tightly wound, hates
violence against animals.

264
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,212
And you're my partner,
Gerald Jimes...

265
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:29,950
A man who solved every crime,
but one...

266
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:33,174
- The murder of his wife.
- Peralta, take this seriously.

267
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,631
I am. As seriously
as you're taking the search

268
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:37,524
for the man
who killed Jane Jimes.

269
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,326
Your only clue?
He wore a yellow sweater.

270
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:44,361
You're considering it.
Let's get in there.

271
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:47,054
NYPD.

272
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:50,057
What's going on? I'm right
in the middle of carving turkey.

273
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,251
I'm vegetarian.
Eating meat is murder.

274
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,175
- I hate violence against animals.
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.

275
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:59,742
We overlooked our release form we were
supposed to have you sign. We apologize.

276
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:03,116
Yeah, he's really right-handed.
Let's go.

277
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,417
♪ Look out, bad guys

278
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:06,185
♪ it's Barley and Jimes

279
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,688
♪ Barley and Jimes
are on the case ♪

280
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:11,393
Please refrain
from make believe this time.

281
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,503
Fine.

282
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:17,098
Evening, ma'am. NYPD.
Barley and Jimes.

283
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:20,601
- We're looking for Donny Romano.
- Ugh. Come in.

284
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:23,804
Donny, what'd you do?
Cops are here.

285
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,091
What do you guys want?

286
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,709
Sorry to bother you, sir,
my partner here

287
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,334
forgot about a form
we need you to sign.

288
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,273
What's happening, Donny?
What'd you do?

289
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:34,598
I didn't do anything.
It's not my fault.

290
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,229
- Same old story. It's never you, is it?
- What did Donny do?

291
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,130
I swear, ma, I don't know
what this is about.

292
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:42,200
- Why won't you ever believe me?
- 'Cause I raised a liar.

293
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:44,235
- You lie.
- Shut up, ma.

294
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,537
Hey, don't
talk to ma like that.

295
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:47,539
Don't you tell me
what to do, Louie!

296
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:48,773
Excuse me.

297
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:49,774
- Hey!
- Not the rolls!

298
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:51,042
George, do something.

299
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:52,743
Excuse me, if...

300
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,647
You know,
you're gonna get hurt.

301
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:56,915
- Get off now.
- Get off.

302
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,651
My wife was murdered by a man
in a yellow sweater!

303
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,528
It's the one case
I can't solve.

304
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,435
Don't fight with family.

305
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:08,926
It can all go away
so quickly.

306
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,628
Sign this?

307
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,738
That's a hell of a breakthrough,
Jimes. I'm proud of you.

308
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:22,008
Also, we just
caught our man.

309
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,810
- He signed with his right hand.
- That's right, he did.

310
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,245
But he didn't do it.

311
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,846
- He did.
- What?

312
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,616
Couldn't help but notice you throwing
those rolls with your left hand, boss.

313
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,869
Not mention, this hoodie matches
our security footage exactly.

314
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,722
You stole that money
when you came in to pick up

315
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,324
your brother from holding
today, didn't you?

316
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,327
- Damn it.
- Nice work, Peralta.

317
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,829
- So where's the money now?
- It's not here, all right?

318
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,863
I bet it all
on the football game.

319
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,298
- My bookie has it.
- Yes!

320
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:45,466
The case continues.

321
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,836
- This is not good.
- Right. Sorry, Jimes.

322
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,772
His father was murdered
by a bookie.

323
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,807
I know you miss him.

324
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,922
Our perp says the bookie operates
out of a hidden back room.

325
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:02,228
- Try to blend in.
- Good idea.

326
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:05,735
I'll just age myself 60 years,
become Chinese and female.

327
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:07,571
Here we go. Whoosh.

328
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,585
- Did it work?
- $10 to play.

329
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,023
- Oh, we're just looking around.
- $40 just to look around.

330
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,760
- All right, we'll play.
- $15 to play.

331
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,195
All right.

332
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,967
- Tommy, can we order some food?
- The cook's gone. I sent him home.

333
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,359
- Do you have any more of these pretzels?
- Sure.

334
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,493
- I'm gonna call the cook.
- Smart. Good call.

335
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,487
Hey, rough night?

336
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,624
Yeah, it certainly hasn't
gone according to plan.

337
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,126
Aw, no. Aw, Amy,

338
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,461
I was ordering a drink
called "A Rough Night."

339
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:43,063
It's tequila
with a nicotine patch.

340
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,832
Right.

341
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,067
How do I get Holt
to pay attention to me?

342
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,203
He sure spends a lot
of time on Peralta.

343
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:52,239
Maybe I should start
screwing up, like Jake does.

344
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:55,075
- I can act out too, you know?
- Please do.

345
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,678
Okay. Watch this.

346
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,318
Oops.

347
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,855
Out...
All of you.

348
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,124
- But the cook is coming back.
- Out!

349
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,640
Fine!

350
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,628
But I'm taking these olives.

351
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,821
Sorry.
Happy Turkey Day.

352
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,608
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

353
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:31,078
These tiles are either
game pieces or candy.

354
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,430
Game pieces. Here we go.

355
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:38,549
I think I just won.

356
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:41,643
The guy by the bathroom seems very
interested in the commotion you just made.

357
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,212
Yeah, and he's been waiting
for the toilet since we got here.

358
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,547
Ten-to-one that's not a bathroom,
and he's a lookout.

359
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,779
- Let's go.
- You got it.

360
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,918
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.

361
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,099
- There is nothing here.
- Don't worry, guys, I found food.

362
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:01,556
Are you eating
packing peanuts?

363
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:04,733
Okay, I do keep a secret stash
of food in the office.

364
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,663
I knew it!
Where?

365
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,203
Where?

366
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:11,472
- Sarge, am I too heavy?
- No. Where is it?

367
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:14,275
- There, the one with the water stain.
- There's a lot of food up there?

368
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,911
Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.

369
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,189
- I think the rats got to it.
- You think?

370
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,091
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened.

371
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,492
Okay, it's over.

372
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,360
Now.

373
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:35,042
No, this will not
be our Thanksgiving.

374
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,610
All right,
you all wait here.

375
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:39,146
Give me an hour.
Terry, to the door.

376
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,514
I'm just gonna
put you down, man.

377
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,776
Yeah, totally. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

378
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,351
Hey, there.
Bathroom?

379
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:46,205
There's another one upstairs,
over there.

380
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,962
Oh. Never mind.
Let's go.

381
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,764
- What, it's really a bathroom?
- No, no, no.

382
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,832
There's tons of illegal stuff
happening in there.

383
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,367
But they're watching the football
game and I DVR'd it.

384
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,550
- I don't wanna see the score.
- What?

385
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,660
Okay, fine.
We'll go get the stolen money.

386
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,894
NYPD. Freeze.

387
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,496
Change the channel
and then freeze.

388
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,165
Put it down!

389
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,500
Put it down,
put it down.

390
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:14,169
This is a weird request, but
will you switch places with me?

391
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,750
I really don't wanna
see the score.

392
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,246
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
That's so much better. Oh!

393
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,349
Why are there
so many TVs in here?

394
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,584
Thank you.

395
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:31,387
The money was still in the bookie's safe.
All the numbers match.

396
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:34,390
- Let's head back to Santiago's party.
- Ah, no thanks.

397
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,654
I think I'm gonna head home
and watch the football game,

398
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,704
which was ruined for me!

399
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,497
What's your problem
with celebrating Thanksgiving?

400
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,778
It's a sucky holiday.
It's always sucked.

401
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:46,347
My mom worked. My dad was gone.
And I sat at home, watching football.

402
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,016
Look, Jake.

403
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,385
I came from
a very formal family.

404
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,820
My parents were not
especially affectionate.

405
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:55,219
Really? "Your Honor"
wasn't a big snuggler?

406
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,794
But the beauty of being an adult
is that you can make a new family

407
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,606
with new traditions.

408
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,342
Well, that's nice, captain, but
I don't have a new family yet,

409
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:06,835
so I guess I'm stuck with
my awesome old traditions.

410
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:09,637
Okay. I'll tell the squad
you couldn't make it.

411
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,771
Thank you.

412
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:12,739
Before you go,
can I borrow some money?

413
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:15,075
I'm getting some pretty serious
vibes from Wendy over there,

414
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,945
and I'd like to take her
someplace special.

415
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,486
Hey. What are y'all
doing here?

416
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,822
Amy broke everything and
got us kicked out of the bar.

417
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,892
Then we got attacked by rats.
It's the best Thanksgiving ever.

418
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,755
Fascinating.

419
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:35,864
Happy Turkey Day.
Right through there, gentlemen.

420
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,231
Not a lot of places
are open,

421
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:40,635
so this will be a multiethnic,
nontraditional Thanksgiving.

422
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,764
It's a real culinary challenge.
Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.

423
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:44,888
Make it five.

424
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,141
You eat with your eyes,
so the plating alone...

425
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,577
Five, Boyle!

426
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:54,347
- Captain?
- Hm?

427
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:55,682
I wanna tell you something.

428
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:58,084
I think you're...

429
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,986
Like, when I was
a little girl...

430
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,555
You think I'm like
when you were a little girl?

431
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,050
- Forget it. The moment's passed.
- Is this about your toast?

432
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:09,254
- How'd you get that?
- Gina gave it to me.

433
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,555
It's very well-written.

434
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:14,254
There are several compelling anecdotes.
The fonts suit the tone.

435
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,655
Good work.

436
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:19,730
I do feel, however, the word choice
could've been improved in spots.

437
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,767
I marked them "Awk"
for "Awkward."

438
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,262
That was the best thing
anyone's ever said to me.

439
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,331
"I marked them 'Awk'
for 'Awkward'?"

440
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:35,157
It's advice.
He's mentoring me.

441
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:37,224
Yes!

442
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:41,005
So this is kind of a play on your
typical Thanksgiving dinner.

443
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,010
For turkey, we have the Peking duck
with a veggie samosa stuffing.

444
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:49,614
The potatoes are the empanadas
with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy.

445
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,283
And for dessert,
some seasonal gelatin cups.

446
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,550
Okay, I ran out of money.

447
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,119
They're from when Hitchcock
got his colonoscopy.

448
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,687
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

449
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:57,921
I'm here, I'm here.

450
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,358
Finally something
to actually be thankful for.

451
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:04,061
- What are you wearing?
- Santiago said to dress up, so...

452
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:05,729
Well, you look beautiful.

453
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:07,631
That's my thing now.
I'm just owning it.

454
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,867
Okay. Before we eat...

455
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,369
- Nope, not doing that again. Move.
- Could you pass the, uh...

456
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:14,686
You get that hand near me again,
you're gonna lose it.

457
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,322
Okey-doke, let's eat.

458
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,743
Hey, thanks for giving a copy
of my toast to Holt.

459
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:21,645
- That was nice of you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

460
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,781
I mean, you don't have to get
so freaked out around him.

461
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:25,997
You were just trying
to tell him you respect him.

462
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,485
Okay.

463
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,056
But, to be honest, I kinda
gave it to him as a prank,

464
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:32,424
'cause I thought it would be
super embarrassing for you.

465
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,793
But I'm happy it worked out.

466
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:37,636
But I would've been happy
if you hated it.

467
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,722
But I'm happy you didn't.

468
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:43,069
So, you pretty much got
the disaster night you were hoping for?

469
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,434
Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving
meal I've ever had and ruined it.

470
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:53,491
Excuse me! Uh, so, earlier at Amy's,
I didn't give a real toast because...

471
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,936
I didn't know what to say.

472
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,961
But, since that time,

473
00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:00,576
a wise, unsmiling man
named Gerald Jimes

474
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,601
made me realize
what I <i>am</i> thankful for.

475
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:06,538
So, I'd just like to say
I'm happy to be here...

476
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,168
With my family.

477
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:12,095
My super-weird family,
with two black dads and...

478
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:15,667
Two Latina daughters
and two white sons and...

479
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,933
Gina, and...

480
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,429
I don't know what you are...
Some strange giant baby?

481
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,388
- To the Nine-Nine!
- To the Nine-Nine!

482
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,960
That was perfect.

483
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,183
Uh, Boyle cries!
I got Boyle Bingo!

484
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,208
- No...
- Yeah!

485
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:33,507

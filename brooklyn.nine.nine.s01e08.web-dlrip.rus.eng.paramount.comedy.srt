1
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:02,599
Careful!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,654
You only get one shot
at this, Peralta.

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:06,228
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

4
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:08,342
I saw the first 15 minutes
of <i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

5
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:09,879
Hurry!
The stench is too much.

6
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,867
<i>We gotta get
those shoes outta here.</i>

7
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:13,116
How much time
do we have?

8
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,942
Scully ate his pot pie
30 minutes ago,

9
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,736
<i>so we probably got 10 minutes
left on this nap.</i>

10
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,563
12 if he's turkey tired.

11
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:20,970
<i>All right, come to papa.</i>

12
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,025
<i>It's trapped.
Abort mission.</i>

13
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,145
I have an idea...

14
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,336
Let's send these shoes
to hell.

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh, wait.

16
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,305
Yeah, just smells
worse than before.

17
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,290
Oh...
Ugh! Abort!

18
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:50,897

19
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:10,961
Whoa! Why are you here
before me?

20
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:12,852
Am I asleep?
Is this a dream?

21
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,355
I am early because
Jimmy Brogan is here today.

22
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:17,696
Why do you care so much
about some old reporter?

23
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,297
Some old reporter?

24
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,219
Is the sky just some
big blue hat

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,564
that the world wears?

26
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:24,742
No. And no one has ever
thought that.

27
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,089
My point exactly.

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,916
Jimmy Brogan
wrote <i>The Squad</i>

29
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,028
about badass New York cops
in the '70s.

30
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,661
<i>It's the best book
I've ever read,</i>

31
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,358
and I've read 15 books.

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,993
50 books is not a lot.
Wait...

33
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,819
You said 15?

34
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,545
<i>The Squad</i>
is what made me decide

35
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:41,082
to become a Detective.

36
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,651
And it was my first
book report.

37
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,251
"The detectives wiped
the mobsters' blood

38
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:47,488
off their boots
and found the scag."

39
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,116
Scag is heroin,
and the book says it's so good,

40
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:52,104
you can never stop doing it!

41
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:53,928
See me after class,
Jacob.

42
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,041
Fun side note...
I late lost my virginity

43
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,578
<i>to Mrs. Stratton's
daughter.</i>

44
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,885
It was... very fast.

45
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,385
Nice.

46
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:04,853
Mr. Brogan, these are
detectives Santiago

47
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:06,070
and Peralta.

48
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:07,992
Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan
of your book.

49
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,721
Would you mind
signing my copy?

50
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,996
I'd love to.
It's always nice to meet a fan.

51
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:13,951
You can just make it out
to "death wish."

52
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,329
That's what everyone
calls me,

53
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,445
'cause I'm always
first through the door.

54
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:18,725
<i>You go through doors normally,</i>

55
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,967
and everyone calls you
pineapples.

56
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:22,280
My grandma calls me
pineapples,

57
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,656
and I regret
telling you that.

58
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,928
Those New York cops
from the '70s you wrote about

59
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:28,871
were my idols... I mean,
Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg.

60
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,438
Those guys
were the real deal.

61
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,158
I once saw Gaminsky
choke a hippy to death

62
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,408
with his own ponytail.

63
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,946
Illegal.
Love that.

64
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,289
Mr. Brogan
is writing an article

65
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,920
about how Brooklyn
detectives have changed

66
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,711
in the 35 years
since <i>The Squad.</i>

67
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,340
He'll be observing
the two of you

68
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,066
on your Internet
identity theft case.

69
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,211
<i>I hope Mr. Brogan's presence
doesn't prove to be</i>

70
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,844
a distraction to you,
Peralta.

71
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,731
Distracted? Me?
No, sir.

72
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,330
Evil would love that.

73
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,049
But I'm not giving evil
the satisfaction.

74
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,806
Not today.

75
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,400
Where's the can?
I gotta unload.

76
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,288
"Unload."
Great choice of words.

77
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:02,271
It'd be an honor
to show you, sir.

78
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,768
All right.
Everyone's here.

79
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,072
Today we're gonna work on
our courtroom demeanor.

80
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,566
Pass.
This seminar

81
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,998
is not optional, Diaz.
You're testifying

82
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,918
in an aggravated assault case
tomorrow.

83
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,453
<i>The D.A. is worried</i>

84
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,052
about how you present yourself
on the stand.

85
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,874
Why?
I'm fine on the stand.

86
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,407
Look, I'll make this
real simple

87
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,879
so even these dum-dums
can understand.

88
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,279
Man did crime.

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,944
I'm sorry... can you
make her stop doing

90
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,737
that weird thing
with her face?

91
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,401
Crying?

92
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,798
And when this is over,
I'm gonna find you,

93
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,165
and I'm gonna break
those little fingers.

94
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,182
Ms. Diaz.

95
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,263
Please stop threatening
the stenographer!

96
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,431
This is an important case.
You need to do well.

97
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:43,062
Fine. I'll take
your dumbass seminar.

98
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,141
That's the spirit!

99
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:49,109
Someone has placed
tiny scanners inside ATMs

100
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,803
to steal card numbers
and pins

101
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,786
which they sell
on the Internet.

102
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,898
Oh, good God, why do you
smell like an ashtray?

103
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,339
Oh, sorry, <i>mom.</i>

104
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,514
It's the only way I can cope
with the stress of the job.

105
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,036
Pffft!

106
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,192
Anyway...
We're running an algorithm

107
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,632
to comb through
the transactions

108
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,166
looking for a pattern
which will lead us

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,020
to the perp's IP address.
Got it.

110
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,747
"Boring mumbo jumbo."

111
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,601
<i>Well, you could think
of the algorithm</i>

112
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,105
as a boot
and the IP address

113
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,417
as some poor slob's skull.

114
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,506
You know?

115
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:20,753
We used to call guys

116
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,707
who bragged about
sitting around all day

117
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,796
hair bags.

118
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,872
Except for
Detective Finaldi.

119
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:29,047
No, he had to sit
around all day.

120
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,124
A mafia thug pried
both his kneecaps off

121
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,467
with a crowbar.

122
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,972
Gah... so lucky.

123
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,733
This kind of data-driven
police work

124
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,592
has reduced crime
by over 70%.

125
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,930
I know hair bag work
when I see it.

126
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:44,217
Do me a favor... wake me
when your shift is over.

127
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,778
No way.

128
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,677
That is amazing!

129
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,600
All you need
is for a jury to like you.

130
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,970
If they like you, they'll trust you.
<i>Fine.</i>

131
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,570
How do I get these morons
to like me?

132
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,379
Don't call them morons.

133
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,011
Good instinct!
Okay.

134
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,729
Sit up straight, all right?
Be aware of your hands, okay?

135
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,041
And don't be afraid
to smile.

136
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,482
And if you need to buy time,
you can always just say,

137
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,052
"to be perfectly candid..."

138
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:12,166
To be perfectly candid...

139
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,478
I like that.

140
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,496
<i>And always make
good eye contact.</i>

141
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,321
But don't stare at people.
Yeah.

142
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:18,921
You gotta blink.
<i>But don't blink too much.</i>

143
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,905
Or too fast.
I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.

144
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,984
Don't blink too fast or too
slow or too much or too little.

145
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,384
I know how to <i>blink.</i>

146
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:26,664
Quick question, sir.

147
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,423
You know how we've been
trading favors back and forth

148
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,672
and it's your turn
to give me one?

149
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,018
None of that is true.
Yeah, I know.

150
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:33,419
Please, can I jump onto
a sweet mob-related homicide?

151
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,755
There are no sweet
mob-related homicides

152
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,099
on which to jump.

153
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,208
Boom!
There's one at the seven-three.

154
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,286
Maybe I should
roll over there, help out.

155
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,335
Brogan can tag along,
maybe write some stuff down.

156
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,578
Why do you idolize that man
and the time he wrote about?

157
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,435
Because the '70s
were amazing.

158
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,293
I mean, everyone had
thick, juicy moustaches

159
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,242
and all the clothes
were orange and flammable.

160
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,160
The '70s were not
a good time for the city

161
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,629
or for the department...

162
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,942
Corruption, brutality,
sexism.

163
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:58,502
Diaz and Santiago never
would have made Detective,

164
00:05:58,536 --> 00:05:59,687
and an openly gay man
like me...

165
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:00,904
I never would have been
given a command.

166
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,567
<i>There were very few
black detectives.</i>

167
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,772
Did I ever tell you what my
first day on the job was like?

168
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,285
Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.

169
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:11,817
Are you... here
to turn yourself in?

170
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:14,890
Ah, yeah,
that's really messed up.

171
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,458
But the guys that Brogan
wrote about...

172
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,283
They were great detectives.
I mean, they were legit.

173
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,564
<i>Some of them were legit.</i>

174
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,828
Some of them were just
Brogan's drinking buddies.

175
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,426
Sir, that is
a brilliant idea.

176
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,378
<i>It wasn't an idea.
It was a scathing indictment</i>

177
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:27,628
of your personal hero.

178
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,837
Eh, six of one.

179
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,311
This is the best!

180
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,623
Drinking with Jimmy Brogan.

181
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,256
So tell me more
about Quigg.

182
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,338
Could he really light
a matchstick on his face?

183
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,845
One time during a drug bust,

184
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,350
he had one of his fingers
shot off.

185
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:41,400
He didn't even flinch.
He just picked it up

186
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:44,953
and used it to flip off
every puerto rican in the place.

187
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,778
And that's my cue.
It's late.

188
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,123
Are you kidding?

189
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,470
The old guard
drank till dawn,

190
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:50,624
ate some coffee grounds,

191
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,768
then started the whole day
all over again.

192
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,911
Pfft!
I eat coffee grounds.

193
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,128
Sure you do, pineapples.

194
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,473
How about
another round?

195
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,627
Are you kidding me?

196
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,102
I wanna hang with you
till one of us dies.

197
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,351
<i>Look, I'm tired
of talking.</i>

198
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,468
Why don't you tell me
some of your stories?

199
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,133
Great. 'Cause I got
some stories

200
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,488
that'll make <i>Training Day</i>
look like <i>Super Troopers.</i>

201
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,930
Eh, it's not... bartender.

202
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,884
Two scotches.

203
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,895
No, no, he meant two bottles.
What?

204
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,261
I mean... yeah!

205
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,502
Aaaalll... right!

206
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,228
You'll never get me!

207
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,221
You'll never get me!

208
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:27,245
We already
got you, idiot.

209
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,486
Look who's here.

210
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,628
How was your night
of old-school drinking, hmm?

211
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,131
Pretty hung over?
Shh!

212
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:36,467
Turn off
your mouth siren.

213
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:39,027
Here are the texts
I got from you last night.

214
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,339
"Best night ever."

215
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,291
"Why scotch burn so good?"

216
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,982
"Whaz his name in <i>Serpico?"</i>

217
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,969
"Who's the friend of yours
with the ping-pong?"

218
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,409
And lastly,

219
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,199
a picture of you
on the subway platform

220
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,857
eating Chinese chicken salad
with no shirt on.

221
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:56,445
Well, last night was awesome.

222
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:59,816
We had an epic night of bonding
that I will never forget.

223
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,113
Do it!
I believe in you.

224
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:08,103
Throw it!
I believe in you.

225
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:09,481
Man, I wonder
if Brogan's okay.

226
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,787
He's 65 and drank
two bottles of scotch.

227
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:13,483
He might be dead.
He looks fine to me.

228
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,476
Morning, kid!

229
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,693
Ooh!
How ya doing?

230
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,358
Uh... hey...

231
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,375
So good.
I feel great.

232
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,710
And I definitely don't think
it's burning hot in here.

233
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,215
Well, I'm around.

234
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,686
Grab me if anything
develops in your case.

235
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:26,157
You got it.

236
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:28,077
That hurt so bad.
Let me know when he's gone

237
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,932
so I can slide
onto the nice, cool floor.

238
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,211
He's gone.
Great.

239
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,810
Mmm...

240
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,146
Oh... my whole body
has dry mouth.

241
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,603
Why are we meeting
in the ladies' room?

242
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,909
It's the perfect place
for our second lesson...

243
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,125
Courthouse wardrobe.

244
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,079
What's wrong
with the way I dress?

245
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,640
You know, some people might
say that all the black leather

246
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,400
kind of makes you looks like
an evil villain.

247
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,841
<i>Not me.</i>

248
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:57,398
I think you look like
a sexy motorcycle.

249
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,998
Boyle, pull it together.

250
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,087
Yeah.

251
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,849
We need to
soften up your look.

252
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,665
My wife and Charles's mom
donated some clothes.

253
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,806
Your wife and Boyle's mom
are both blind?

254
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:11,713
I look like arsenio.

255
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:14,018
So it's... perfect?

256
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,183
That's actually
my wedding suit.

257
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:18,400
No.

258
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,969
Yes.

259
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,187
No.
No.

260
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,085
That's great.
Perfect!

261
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,270
You look beautiful... ly...

262
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,190
Appropriate for court.

263
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,278
♪ A new sensation

264
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,686
Ohh...

265
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,806
Scully.

266
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,821
Hey, Jake.
You've been alive forever.

267
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,423
How'd you used to cure
hangovers?

268
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,985
Oh, I didn't drink.
I was, however,

269
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:41,422
extremely into cocaine
for most of 1986.

270
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,895
I gotta tell you the truth,
Hitchcock...

271
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,463
Can I tell you the truth?
You and me, man.

272
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:45,968
We're gonna be co-captains.

273
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,697
But first I'm taking you
to Japan!

274
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:49,652
I'm already packed!

275
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,606
I had three heart attacks
that year

276
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,662
and declared bankruptcy.

277
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,648
Hitchcock turned out
just fine.

278
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,143
My grandpa
was an old-school cop.

279
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:00,312
This was his hangover cure...
Raw egg yolks.

280
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,879
Aaahhh!

281
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,823
You look like a corpse
we just pulled out of the river.

282
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,297
Wrong. I look like
a cool rock star

283
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:07,867
who oded in his own pool.
Big difference.

284
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,372
I told you not to let
Jimmy Brogan

285
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,782
distract you
from your work.

286
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,376
So I assume you're not
too hung over to do said work?

287
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:16,482
Pfft. Nope. It's like
I never even drank.

288
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,570
And that's not
a hangover cure.

289
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,711
What, that?
Naw, it's just some...

290
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,857
Protein for my guns.

291
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,995
I drink one every morning
before I lift.

292
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:26,884
So...

293
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,300
Gah!

294
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,868
Ah ha ha!

295
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:34,566
So good!

296
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,225
You can barely even tell
it's a chicken embryo.

297
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:38,828
You should drink it all.

298
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,270
For your guns.

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,655
Yeah.

300
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,929
Agh.

301
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,528
Ah, it's just like...

302
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,352
Fitness, right?

303
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,642
Oh, why did I do this?

304
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,659
According to your text,
you were having

305
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,130
"the beef light
of my loaf."

306
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,626
What? No, no. Why did
I use this algorithm?

307
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:06,677
We're only tracking people
who use the stolen cards.

308
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,533
They might not be the same
as the ones who stole them.

309
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,902
Here,
switch seats with me.

310
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,476
Oh, wow.
Your butt's really warm.

311
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,526
My butt's normal.
Your butt's the weird one.

312
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,775
Don't be mad.
It's nice.

313
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,756
All right, so if we ignore
all these fraudulent purchases

314
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,677
and go back far enough...

315
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,271
Here. Someone posted
the stolen card numbers online

316
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,807
from this IP address.

317
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,789
Not bad!
You found the pattern.

318
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,028
All right, let's aspirin up
and roll out!

319
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,300
Ah... ohh!

320
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,324
Ohh...

321
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:39,905
I'm glad you could
be here for this.

322
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:42,849
Mike Halbrook.

323
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,288
NYPD. Open up.

324
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,144
Put your head
through the door.

325
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,264
My head?

326
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,568
We got a runner!

327
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,040
Stop!
Hands in the air!

328
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,351
Oh, wow.

329
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,750
Hoo! Yeah!

330
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:01,667
Good job.
I'm never drinking again.

331
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,930
Hey. You know,
I was gonna take him out myself,

332
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,105
but ladies first, so...

333
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,482
Relax, kid.

334
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,244
Being too hung over
to chase a perp?

335
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,390
That's a classic
old-school move.

336
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:15,402
You know, you are one of
the last few good cops

337
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,769
fighting against
the rising tide of hair bags.

338
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,818
That's what you're gonna
say in your article?

339
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:21,065
Ah, don't worry,

340
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,857
you're gonna come out
lookin' real good.

341
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,523
Especially after
our talk in the bar.

342
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,218
Ah...
So many good quotes!

343
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:27,947
Especially about Holt.

344
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,419
Cops are usually afraid

345
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,562
to go after their
captains like that,

346
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:35,592
but you, sir,
are old-school.

347
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,419
You know it.

348
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,051
Oh, pineapples...

349
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,034
What did you do?

350
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,359
Your witness counselor.

351
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,792
Detective Diaz, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

352
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:48,136
This is not good.

353
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,697
The lawyer is that slimeball
grundhaven... Rosa hates him!

354
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,266
She's dressed right.
We coached her.

355
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:53,995
She'll be okay.

356
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,719
<i>Would you please state
your name for the record?</i>

357
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,929
To be perfectly candid...

358
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,497
My name is
Detective Rosa Diaz.

359
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,778
Well, thank you for
your candor

360
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,444
regarding your own name.

361
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,295
<i>Detective Diaz,</i>

362
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:07,673
would you please
tell the court

363
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,179
exactly how you're
involved in this case?

364
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:11,229
I caught Mr. Ladd
physically beating his boss

365
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,374
<i>with a fax machine.
Most of his cheek</i>

366
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:14,687
was caved in.

367
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,576
His head was basically
a blood fountain.

368
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,785
I'm sorry, is this
amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?

369
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,539
Blinking.

370
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh, no.

371
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,034
Brogan just sent me
the quotes he's gonna run.

372
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,987
I slammed Holt
like 50 times.

373
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:32,267
Listen.

374
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,516
"Holt would rather
I wear a tie

375
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,637
"than solve a case.

376
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:36,717
"Holt cares more about
catching clerical errors

377
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,573
"than catching bad guys.

378
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:41,230
Holt is way too
verticulis"?

379
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,440
That's not even a word!
What were you thinking?

380
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,168
We were just hanging out,
being old-school.

381
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:46,770
He wasn't supposed
to quote me.

382
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,884
I was off the record
the whole time.

383
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:50,296
Oh, no wait.

384
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,642
I'm goin' on the record.

385
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:54,526
Jake Peralta...
Can dance!

386
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,655
Whoo!
Whoo!

387
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:01,026
Jimmy Brogan!

388
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,532
You need to fix this,
okay?

389
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,263
Those quotes
cannot run.

390
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,214
It would be
devastating for Holt.

391
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,423
And the department.
I'll fix it.

392
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:10,472
Brogan's a cool guy.
We're friends now.

393
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,131
I'll just talk to him,
awesome dude to awesome dude.

394
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,534
I should brush my teeth
first, though, right?

395
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,944
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's terrible.

396
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,415
Ugh!

397
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,729
Great advice, dummies.

398
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,041
I look like a psycho
up there!

399
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,028
Yes. You have to
pull it together.

400
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,816
That's not helping!
That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous.

401
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:27,514
Rosa, I think
you're nervous.

402
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:28,957
Of course I'm nervous!

403
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,367
What did you think
was the problem?

404
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,488
We just assumed you were
a terrifying human being

405
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:32,672
with a short fuse.

406
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,008
But if the problem
is that you're nervous,

407
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,154
that's where
Charles Boyle lives, baby.

408
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:38,659
I can help!
You just need to go

409
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,972
to your happy place.

410
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,058
What's that?
Sounds stupid.

411
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,627
Oh, everyone's happy place
is different.

412
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:45,067
For me, I just imagine
I'm slurping up

413
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,021
the world's longest
piece of linguini.

414
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,263
It just keeps going
and going.

415
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,147
Every 20 feet of noodle,
there's a sauce change.

416
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,229
I'm in my happy place
right now.

417
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,860
Mmm... pesto.

418
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,514
Mmm! Carbonara!

419
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:01,012
Great!
Now I'm starving!

420
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,842
Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan.

421
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:08,795
Thanks for meeting me.

422
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,202
Welcome to
the Schvitz, kid.

423
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:12,861
The most comfortable
place on earth.

424
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,783
It's like crawling back
into your mother.

425
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,448
Is that something
people wanna do?

426
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,825
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?

427
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:20,930
So I read those quotes
you sent me,

428
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,236
and you...
Wrote them so good.

429
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:24,933
The thing is...

430
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,215
I know I hid it
incredibly well,

431
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,002
but I was pretty drunk
when I said that stuff, so...

432
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,379
Any chance
you wouldn't print it?

433
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,490
Well, you said you were
going on the record.

434
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:34,441
I was clearly
not in control.

435
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:37,158
Well, maybe you should learn
to handle your brown.

436
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,534
Eew.

437
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:40,037
Look, you know
that I think

438
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,110
you're like the number one
hero of the 20th century.

439
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,968
But kinda feel like
you're being unfair here.

440
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,855
"Feel like"?
Listen to her,

441
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,447
Suzanne Somers over here.
Talk like a man.

442
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,920
All right,
I will talk like a man.

443
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,779
You got me drunk
and took advantage of me.

444
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,540
Oh, come on.
Gah!

445
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,855
Look, I'm asking you
nicely...

446
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,649
Please don't print
the quotes.

447
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,863
And I'm telling you nicely,
I'm printing them.

448
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,272
No, you're not.

449
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:03,802
What are you gonna
do about it?

450
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:10,523
Hey, how'd it go with Brogan?
<i>Perfect.</i>

451
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:11,773
Except I punched him
in the face

452
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,214
and made everything
a billion times worse.

453
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,173
What?

454
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,952
Yeah.

455
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:24,554
So, Detective Diaz,

456
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,498
you saw my client
struggling with his boss,

457
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,355
but you don't know
who initiated the fight.

458
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:29,476
<i>To be perfectly candid,</i>

459
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:31,636
I was pretty sure
it was the defendant.

460
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,998
Oh, to be perfectly candid,
"pretty sure" is not definitive.

461
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,328
I think I know
what happened.

462
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,578
Well,
to be perfectly candid,

463
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,680
no one cares what you think.

464
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,280
<i>Do you actually know
anything,</i>

465
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,383
or are you just guessing?

466
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,439
Your client instigated
the fight.

467
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,849
I'm certain.

468
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,485
And I'm happy
to tell you why.

469
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,797
Yes!

470
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,142
She went to
her happy place.

471
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,424
I know that, Boyle.

472
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,016
You punched
Jimmy Brogan?

473
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,207
What were you thinking?

474
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,225
I was thinking

475
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,609
that I needed to protect
this precinct.

476
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,908
From things that I said
about this precinct

477
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,277
to a reporter while drunk
and insisting he record me.

478
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:06,782
I shouldn't have done it.
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

479
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,480
Every time I think you might
make a decent Detective,

480
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:09,634
you go and pull
something like this.

481
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,867
I thought I could
handle my brown.

482
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,435
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's gross.

483
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,776
Go home!

484
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,521
You got the rest of the day
to put your head on straight.

485
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:27,001
Got Halbrook to cop
to every charge.

486
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,759
Nice work, Santiago.
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

487
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
Peralta figured out
the pattern, though,

488
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,217
so he should get credit
for the collar.

489
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,338
Have you seen him?

490
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,324
I sent him home.
He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.

491
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:38,238
Yeah. But that caveman
kinda had it coming,

492
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,582
don't you think?

493
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,986
Oh. He didn't tell you.

494
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,940
Tell me what?
Never mind.

495
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,309
If Jake didn't tell you,
he must have had a reason.

496
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,027
It's not my place.
I'm disappointed in you, Santiago.

497
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,842
I thought
you and I were close.

498
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,954
I know you're
manipulating me...

499
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:55,074
But I love it,

500
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,124
and I will tell you
anything.

501
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,588
So Jake went to the Schvitz
to talk to Brogan.

502
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,637
What are you gonna
do about it?

503
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,488
There's nothing
I can do...

504
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,114
Except to ask you nicely
as a fan of you,

505
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,546
your work, and the guys
you wrote about...

506
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:13,859
Please don't print
the quotes.

507
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,075
Sheesh. I didn't realize

508
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:16,483
you were gonna get your panties
all in a pretzel!

509
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:18,274
That's actually not
technically possible.

510
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,650
I'm not wearing underwear.

511
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:22,146
It is swampy in here.
My butt's like the everglades.

512
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,709
Look, I know you're trying to
be legit in a hair bag world,

513
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,788
so I will not print
your quotes.

514
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,421
Ah, thank you,
thank you!

515
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:29,797
That means
the world to me.

516
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,204
And for the record,

517
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:32,613
I know that Holt
is a stickler,

518
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:33,989
but he's actually
a really good cop.

519
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,229
Don't worry about it.
We're friends.

520
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,982
You don't have to stick up
for that homo.

521
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,932
I really wish you
hadn't just said that.

522
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,919
What, homo?

523
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,880
Ooh!

524
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,454
Thank you, Santiago.
That'll be all.

525
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,749
Here she is.

526
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,725
Diaz, you did it.

527
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,517
They found him guilty
on all charges.

528
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,021
Huh. Boyle's advice
worked.

529
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,996
So...

530
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,755
Where's your happy place?

531
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:05,124
I'm in a cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

532
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,532
Inside it's just me

533
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,062
and that stupid,
slimy defense attorney.

534
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,561
And I'm beating
the hell out of him.

535
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,673
I break a dining room table
over his head.

536
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:15,497
Then I rip off his arm

537
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,291
and shove it
where the sun don't shine.

538
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,372
Then I reach down
his throat

539
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,552
and shake his hand.

540
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,164
Yeah. Okay.

541
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,013
I'm gonna go ahead and schedule
you for a psych eval.

542
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,703
I owe you one, Boyle.

543
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,889
Thank-you dinner.
Tomorrow night.

544
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,005
Gribaldi's.
It's all-you-can-eat linguini.

545
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,503
Yes!

546
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:38,943
Oh, my boyfriend's
coming too.

547
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,238
Your what friend now?

548
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,259
<i>All right.</i>

549
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,828
Let's hear it.

550
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,815
Well, it's even worse
than I imagined.

551
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,023
"The new face of the NYPD

552
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,713
is perfectly embodied by
Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta..."

553
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:53,834
That's not so bad.

554
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,532
"Who cowers behind
his desk all day

555
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,421
like the true hair bag
that he is."

556
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:58,764
There it is.

557
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,716
"The old guard would have
eaten a guy like Peralta

558
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:03,600
for breakfast
and unloaded him by lunch."

559
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,163
Well, it's very colorful.
And hurtful.

560
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,947
You can ignore
that garbage, Santiago.

561
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,124
Jimmy Brogan wouldn't
know a legit cop

562
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:13,622
if he punched him
in the face.

563
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,331
Well...

564
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:21,210
Guess I'm done
with this.

565
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:24,157
Not good enough.

566
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,528
Three, two, one...

567
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,188
Welcome to the party, pal!

568
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,014
God,
you love that movie.

569
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,629
It's <i>Die Hard.</i>

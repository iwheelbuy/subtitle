You were late again.

160
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,799
Well, I had to put on
my undercover minivan disguise.

161
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,201
Say hello
to Harvey Norgenbloom,

162
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:19,239
CPA, recently divorced
father of two

163
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,374
with a dark sexual secret.

164
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,710
- What's your cover?
- Angry Captain.

165
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:27,981
Okay, so you do not like
my ensemble.

166
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,948
I'm just concerned
that you may find it hard

167
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,484
to pursue a criminal on foot
while wearing man sandals.

168
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,890
But the sandals
define Harvey.

169
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,995
He's a sandals guy.

170
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,829
[Sighs]

171
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,596
Captain, why the babysitting?
Why are you micromanaging me?

172
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:43,495
You think I wanna be
sitting here with you

173
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:44,730
instead of running
my precinct?

174
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,400
Yes.
It was a rhetorical question.

175
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,103
I've spent
the last 12 years

176
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,673
fighting
for my first command,

177
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,244
and I'm not gonna
let you screw it up

178
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,080
because you refuse
to take your job seriously.

179
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,482
Hey, I do take
my job seriously.

180
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,317
I put away bad guys.
That's what matters.

181
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:58,852
Well, so does doing
your paperwork,

182
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,485
showing up on time,
wearing proper footwear.

183
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,254
That's on Harvey.
That's not me.

184
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,655
Well, so here's
the deal.

185
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,156
You're gonna have
a superior officer

186
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,259
babysitting you
on every one of your cases.

187
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,694
And when you show me
that you can do your job...

188
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,867
Every part of your job...
Perfectly,

189
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,440
then I'll back off.

190
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,675
Okay.
Counteroffer.

191
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:21,475
I give you 50 bucks, and you
let me do whatever I want.

192
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,514
Fine.
We'll do it your way.

193
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:25,782
From this point on,
I'll do

194
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:28,218
every part
of the job perfectly,

195
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,955
perfecter than perfectly.

196
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:32,793
It's "more perfectly."
You said that imperfectly.

197
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,060
I was testing you.
You did perfectly.

198
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,959
Quick update
on the tagger situation...

199
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,026
He is currently spray-painting
our van right now.

200
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,329
Police, freeze!

201
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,230
Ow, ow, ow.

202
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,831
Sandal down.

203
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,198
Lost a sandal.
NYPD, freeze!

204
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,632
I'm here.

205
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,130
You're busted.

206
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,532
Already got him.
We got him.

207
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:01,440
Oh, hey, Captain.

208
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:05,477
Hi, so I was able to procure
that $50 after all,

209
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,278
and my offer
still stands.

210
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,213
Let me do whatever I want,
and the $40...

211
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:11,449
That's how much
I actually have... is yours.

212
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,055
No? Fair enough.
I only had 30 anyway.

213
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,623
Well, I guess
in order to get you

214
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:17,258
to stop micromanaging me,
I'm gonna have to get back

215
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,560
to the most important piece
of police work there is:

216
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,961
Writing a perfect report.

217
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,696
Good, I'm anxious
to read it.

218
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:26,236
And I'm anxious to restore
my status as a lone wolf.

219
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:29,641
[Howls]

220
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,976
Anything else, Detective?

221
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,444
Yeah, I'm gonna do
one more.

222
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,913
[Howls]

223
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,982
Lone wolf.

224
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,585
He's digging me.

225
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,253
[Clicks tongue]

226
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,420
Hey, sarge, do you know
where we keep the glitter?

227
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,420
Just wanna make sure
this report for the Captain

228
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:47,586
is extra sparkly.

229
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,920
What are you doing,
Peralta?

230
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:50,688
Look, if I have to do things
his way,

231
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,023
I'm gonna do them
my way.

232
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,991
[Laughs]
Okay, man.

233
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
It was nice working with you.
[Laughs]

234
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:57,893
I'm not scared of him,
okay?

235
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,531
I'm not scared
of anyone.

236
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,332
Oh, also, the tagger drew
a penis on your minivan.

237
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,166
I'm sorry.
Please don't chase after me.

238
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,713
What?
There's a penis on my minivan?

239
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:10,272
High ceilings,
three bedrooms.

240
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,677
Why does every perp
have a nicer place than I do?

241
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,810
You know what they don't
teach you at the academy?

242
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:15,932
It's better to be
a criminal.

243
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:19,317
Oh, no.
The cabinets are blue.

244
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:21,121
Tacky.
Not a deal breaker, though.

245
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,490
I'd just repaint it.

246
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:24,359
The psychic predicted
the drugs

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,640
would be found
in something blue.

248
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:28,796
[Slow motion]
I see the color blue.

249
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:30,799
She also made this really
depressing prediction

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,134
about my life.

251
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:35,171
[Slow motion]
She will never love you back.

252
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,910
And if she's right
about where we find the drugs,

253
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,111
that means she's right
about the other thing.

254
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,380
- Uh-huh.
- Kitchen.

255
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,521
- Whoa.
- Jackpot.

256
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,726
There's way more
than 12 keys in here.

257
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:49,894
Where was it?

258
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,663
Baseboard,
behind the hamper.

259
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,498
What color
was the hamper?

260
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:54,498
- <i>Green.</i>
- Yes.

261
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:55,832
The clothes hamper
was green.

262
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,904
The clothes hamper was green!

263
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,706
Drinks on me.

264
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,640
[Laughs]
You're weird.

265
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,509
[Engine starts]

266
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,178
Sorry this is
taking so long.

267
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,379
Still writing up
my report.

268
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,082
Pretty detailed.

269
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,284
Hey, Gina, can you look up
what the humidity was

270
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,687
about an hour ago and also
what moon cycle we're in?

271
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,992
No, sorry.
Don't feel like it, no.

272
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:21,195
Thanks, Gina.

273
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,031
And now to you.
What's your name?

274
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,900
My name is
banana fartman, md.

275
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:26,269
I don't believe you.

276
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,404
Come on, man.
Just tell me who you are.

277
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:29,738
I need to fill
this thing out perfectly,

278
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,507
so my boss
will get off my back.

279
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,843
Are you a minor?
How old are you?

280
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:34,778
I'm 610.
I'm a highlander.

281
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,646
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put that in there.

282
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,882
And then you're gonna be tried
as an adult highlander.

283
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,084
And they're gonna cut
your head off.

284
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,286
Is that what you want?

285
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,557
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

286
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,728
but your psychic
friend's predictions

287
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,398
about the drug case
were wrong,

288
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,470
which means all
of her predictions are wrong.

289
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:53,572
Mm-mm. No way.
She's never wrong.

290
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:55,606
We found the cocaine
behind a green hamper.

291
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,644
Never said green
or the letter "H."

292
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,751
Mm-hmm, she said
"blue" and "yellow," Charles.

293
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,986
I don't know if there's
any kindergarteners present,

294
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:05,422
but those two colors combined
make green.

295
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:09,227
She also mentioned
the letters "L" and "B,"

296
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:12,566
and another name
for a hamper is...

297
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,603
Lady bin?

298
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:16,705
Laundry basket.

299
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:18,442
Oh, little boo-boo.

300
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,846
Can you go be depressed
over there?

301
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,348
You're bumming out
my whole area.

302
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,582
Baby, I've got
some bad news.

303
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:30,454
Someone painted a giant penis
on our minivan.

304
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,223
No, you cannot have
an SUV now.

305
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,626
Those things roll, baby.
They roll!

306
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,796
Hey, look at this.

307
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,700
Your prints were
on file.

308
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,874
Nice to meet you,
Trevor Podolski.

309
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:48,146
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

310
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:52,219
Your father is deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

311
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,689
I'm not sure
how things work here,

312
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,760
but does that mean
that your career is in my hands?

313
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,498
Okay, you know what?

314
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,667
Yes.

315
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,868
20.2 kilos.

316
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,169
I feel like
we could round up to 21.

317
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:12,573
Or we could round down
to 20,

318
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:16,243
take the extra 0.2,
sell it to our friends.

319
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,983
[Giggles]

320
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,252
I'll call the D.A.
Rosa, you log this in.

321
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,854
Charles, maybe watch Gina.

322
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:25,022
[Laughs]

323
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,223
So what are
you doing tonight?

324
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,194
Nothing.
What about you...

325
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,530
Are doing tonight?

326
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:33,370
Nothing.

327
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,738
Carlene.

328
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,242
Whelp, I hope you find
something to do.

329
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,045
[Chuckles]

330
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:44,415
I'm gonna pee.
That's what I'm doing tonight.

331
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,851
No.

332
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,253
[Sighs]

333
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,889
Deputy commissioner's son, huh?
[Sighs]

334
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,724
His decision to target cop cars
makes a lot more sense now.

335
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,091
We gotta let him walk,
right?

336
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,725
He defaced
nine police vehicles,

337
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,025
and you caught him
red-handed.

338
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,057
Why would you let him walk?
[Chuckles]

339
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:02,959
Captain, I did all the work
on this perfectly.

340
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,028
I mean, my report
has over 25 pages

341
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,866
of meticulous research,
diagrams, and maps.

342
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,772
I even put an "about the author"
section on the back.

343
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,242
I did everything
you asked me to do,

344
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,710
but this is
above my pay grade.

345
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,245
You gotta make the call.

346
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,714
You're the arresting officer.
It's your call.

347
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,916
I told you to do
every part of your job,

348
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,386
and making this call
is part of your job.

349
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,891
- Yeah, but you think I should process him.
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,626
Well, if I do,
the deputy commissioner

351
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,161
could ruin my career,
and I'll end up on the streets

352
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,064
selling my beautiful body
for a can of beans.

353
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,767
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,905
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like a statue?

355
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,273
Yes.

356
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:43,977
Man, you were totally right
about the cocaine,

357
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:45,913
and you were also right
about Rosa.

358
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,648
Who's Rosa?
The woman I...

359
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,616
The woman who doesn't
love him back.

360
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,084
Oh.
Yes, that woman.

361
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,852
You know, it can be a burden
to always know

362
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,353
what's gonna happen
in the future.

363
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,921
Don't get out
of the chair.

364
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,325
I just had a vision
of you leaving this chair

365
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,960
and getting
seriously injured.

366
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,494
Oh, my God.

367
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,628
I should probably wheel you
back to your desk.

368
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,763
That is a great idea.
Wheel you off a bridge.

369
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:07,264
[Laughs]
I'm kidding.

370
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,597
♪ Oh, you're alone

371
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,101
♪ Uh-oh, you're alone
for life ♪

372
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,105
So here are my options.

373
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,707
One, I process
Podolski's kid,

374
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,475
he fires me, and I spend
the rest of my career

375
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,313
as a Detective, third grade,
which is literally pathetic.

376
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:24,086
No offense, Hitchcock.
None taken.

377
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,290
Option two,
I let him walk,

378
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,525
and I spend the rest
of my life with Holt

379
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,460
as my babysitter.

380
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,295
Honestly, when I think about
spending the rest of my life

381
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:32,796
with a babysitter,

382
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,232
she's kind of a cute blonde
named Erica,

383
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,702
and she always has
pizza money

384
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,071
and lets me stay up as late
as I want.

385
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,675
How old are you
in this scenario?

386
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:41,745
Anyway, the point is
Holt cares more

387
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,314
about whether I
"do my job right"

388
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,017
than whether I have a job
at all.

389
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,386
So I'm taking suggestions.

390
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,256
I say piss off Holt,

391
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:51,258
so we get to watch your career
end right in front of us.

392
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,093
Okay, thank you
for that, Santiago.

393
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,562
I'm gonna put you down
for "don't arrest,"

394
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,064
and I'm also going
to put your phone number

395
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,567
on every urinal
in Rikers.

396
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:00,037
Don't arrest him.
Just smack him. Hard.

397
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:01,505
With a phone book
on a body part

398
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:03,004
no one can see,
you know what I'm saying?

399
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,906
So you're suggesting
police brutality?

400
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:07,109
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah.
Why?

401
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,111
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

402
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:10,682
You want this collar?
Paperwork's all done,

403
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:13,351
and it's perfect.
The Podolski kid?

404
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,186
Are you kidding?
I just gave him my lunch.

405
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:18,055
Okay.
Boyle, what do you think?

406
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:20,190
I don't know, man.
I'm lost.

407
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,290
The universe is
a cruel and vexing puzzle.

408
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,623
I-I'm at the whim
of the cosmos.

409
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,361
All right, I'm gonna put
you down for "bummer,"

410
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:31,898
and you can hang out in
that category all by yourself.

411
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,599
Hey, everyone.

412
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,369
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy,
angry official here,

413
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,204
deputy commissioner Podolski.

414
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,975
He's asking for you.
Very angry.

415
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,778
Elderly, sexy, furious.

416
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,114
Well, my career
is over.

417
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,714
See you at the bottom,
Hitchcock. No offense.

418
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,813
No, none taken.

419
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,547
Deputy commissioner.

420
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:58,647
Where's my son?

421
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,316
He is at my desk,

422
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,821
enjoying a nice glass
of bubbly water

423
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:05,058
and some chocolate I was saving
for a special occasion.

424
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,729
Hey, Peralta,
when you're done,

425
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,900
can you help me wrap up
this massive cocaine bust

426
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,502
I just pulled off?
Thanks.

427
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,071
Oh, deputy commissioner,
didn't see you there.

428
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,672
Sorry for interrupting.

429
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,340
Amy Santiago.

430
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,908
[Sighs]

431
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:21,078
Trevor, what'd you do
this time?

432
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,313
Nothing.

433
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,549
There you have it.
He said he did nothing.

434
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,184
So I caught him red-handed
doing nothing?

435
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,184
I'm saying maybe
it's a possibility

436
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,650
you made a mistake.

437
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,118
You know, normally,
I would agree with you,

438
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,021
but I've been
pretty detail-oriented

439
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,123
the last few hours.

440
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,660
You might not
understand this,

441
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,098
but Trevor is
a special kid.

442
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,832
He makes straight "A"s.
He's going to Duke next year.

443
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,934
Lacrosse scholarship.
Oh.

444
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,705
Sometimes, boys
just need to be boys.

445
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:48,811
You do realize
he did thousands of dollars

446
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,846
worth of property damage,
though,

447
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,481
to police vehicles.

448
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,449
Look, I think
we can all agree

449
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,552
that I'm ordering you
to let this slide

450
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,189
because nothing happened.

451
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,193
This is officially
out of your hands.

452
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:03,633
Would you actually mind
just checking out my report?

453
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:04,834
It's pretty thorough,

454
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:07,335
and I spent over an hour
on fonts.

455
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,502
Kinda snazzy, so...

456
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:10,302
Oh, thank you.

457
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:11,469
I'll get right to it.

458
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,638
Thanks.
Trevor, let's go.

459
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,341
Have a good one.

460
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:25,286
Choo.

461
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,387
Yes.

462
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:28,022
What's up with the chair?

463
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:31,491
Um, Carlene predicted
if I get out of this chair,

464
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,827
I'd get badly hurt,
so I'm not chancing it.

465
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:37,763
Oh, man.
There's no pudding cups left.

466
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,965
Ah!
What'd you do that for?

467
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:43,333
There.
Now you're hurt <i>in</i> this chair.

468
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:44,801
You can get hurt anywhere,
Boyle.

469
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,637
And if you do,
it won't be

470
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:50,576
because some shoe salesman
predicted it.

471
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,616
You make
your own destiny.

472
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:00,987
Well, we don't have to worry
about Podolski's son anymore.

473
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,889
The case is officially
out of my hands.

474
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,056
No charges filed.

475
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,660
Why is there yogurt
on this?

476
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,395
The deputy commissioner
threw my report

477
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:09,130
in Terry's trash can,

478
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,796
and he'd been eating
yogurt earlier.

479
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:13,764
Terry loves yogurt.

480
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,167
Something wrong?
Kinda, yeah.

481
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:17,904
I called six precincts
about this kid.

482
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,707
He's been brought in
a dozen times.

483
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,744
Theft, vandalism,
drunken disorderly,

484
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,178
but he's never
been processed.

485
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:26,011
His daddy comes in
and bails him out every time.

486
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,378
He's a lucky little jerk.

487
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:29,011
No, I wouldn't say
he was lucky.

488
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:30,579
I feel bad for this kid.

489
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,547
I mean,
what kind of father

490
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:33,915
cares so little
for his son

491
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,220
that he lets him get away
with everything?

492
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,188
Well, he's someone else's
problem now.

493
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:42,990
Like you said,
it's out of your hands.

494
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:43,991
All right, I see
what you're trying to do,

495
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,656
but it's not gonna work.

496
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,492
I'm not going to arrest him.
I'm going to arrest him!

497
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,862
- You want backup?
- Yes.

498
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,032
[Siren wails]

499
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,005
What is this?
You can't do this.

500
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,473
Get that thing
outta here.

501
00:18:58,507 --> 00:18:59,841
Excuse me, sir.

502
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,877
Trevor Podolski,
you're under arrest

503
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:03,613
for vandalism
and destruction of property.

504
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,048
What... dad!
What are you doing?

505
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,251
I told you
to back off, Peralta.

506
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,423
First off,
the name's Santiago,

507
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:10,460
Detective Amy Santiago.

508
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,361
Second, I'm arresting
your son,

509
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:16,963
which, as I say it aloud,
seems like an unwise choice,

510
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:18,799
but it's the one
I'm making.

511
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,002
Once again,
my name is Amy Santiago.

512
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,274
You're being stupid, Peralta.
Don't be stupid.

513
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,110
I can make
your life miserable.

514
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,881
Commissioner, please don't talk
to my Detective in that Tone.

515
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:29,448
If you have a complaint,
you can take it up with me.

516
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:33,083
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, Holt.

517
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,818
I'm gonna be watching you,
both of you, like a hawk.

518
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:36,919
You're gonna have to try
a little harder

519
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,455
if you wanna scare me.

520
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,757
I've been an openly gay cop
since 1987,

521
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,826
so you're not the first
superior officer to threaten me.

522
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:45,661
You know
how I'm still standing here?

523
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,563
'Cause I do my job,

524
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,167
and I do it right.

525
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:51,570
Damn, son!

526
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,538
Don't say "son."
Sorry.

527
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,273
Deputy commissioner,
if you wanna pick Trevor up,

528
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:58,142
he'll be
at the nine-nine.

529
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,507
Let's go, fartman.

530
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,944
Carlene was wrong, Gina.

531
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,648
Rosa said it herself...
I'm in charge of my own destiny.

532
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,318
That means she wants me
to make a move.

533
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:10,488
Mm, but Carlene
was also right.

534
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,924
You did get hurt
'cause Rosa punched you.

535
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,591
And the fact that Rosa
punched you

536
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:15,992
means she does not
like you.

537
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:18,759
No, no, she punched me
to prove Carlene wrong.

538
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,760
Move.

539
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,128
Oh, wait,
I take it back.

540
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,929
She definitely is
into you.

541
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,067
So much chemistry.
I know, it's crazy.

542
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,603
All right, let's get
this meeting started.

543
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,772
<i>I'm not late.
I'm here.</i>

544
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:33,781
[Alarm beeping]

545
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,856
Right on time.

546
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:41,792
You're out of uniform,
Peralta.

547
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,862
Baby steps, Captain.

548
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:46,682
Baby steps.

1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,543
Ah, Captain.
You're at my desk.

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:07,235
Just what I wanna see
first thing in the morning.

3
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,067
You're three minutes late,
Peralta.

4
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,564
Not my fault.
I had a plumbing problem.

5
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:12,653
[Musical ringtone]

6
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:15,061
[Groans]

7
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:16,983
Which reminds me,
I'm gonna need

8
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,513
a new
departmentally issued phone.

9
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:21,402
Oh, come on, really?
I'm a few minutes late,

10
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:22,764
so you're gonna call me out
in front of everyone?

11
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:24,726
Good idea.
Everyone?

12
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:27,369
Gather round, so I can call out
Peralta in front of you.

13
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,451
Okay, fine.
I was three minutes late.

14
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:32,119
I'm sorry for doing
one thing wrong.

15
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,531
- Oh, it's more than one thing.
- Uh-oh.

16
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:35,611
Let's start
with the Kristov murder.

17
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:36,863
It was
an amazing solve.

18
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,081
I got him to confess
in 20 minutes.

19
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:39,460
You also mislabeled
the evidence,

20
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:41,418
so that confession
is worthless

21
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,119
if the sergeant
hadn't caught your mistake.

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,945
Here are three cases
with sloppy paperwork.

23
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,676
Here are two pictures.

24
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,246
One is your locker.

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,166
The other is a garbage dump
in the Philippines.

26
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:55,717
Can you tell
which is which?

27
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,024
- That one's the dump?
- They're both your locker.

28
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,529
Gah, I should've guessed that.
He's good.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,795
This folder is labeled
"undies, dirty."

30
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:04,748
So I won't confuse it
with "undies, clean."

31
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:06,511
Also, who cares
about all these rules?

32
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,978
I have more felony arrests
than any other Detective here.

33
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,476
You also have more mice
living in your desk

34
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,397
than any other Detective.

35
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,350
[Gasps] Algernon.
[All aw]

36
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:17,273
You guys,
Algernon's back.

37
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:20,379
Get rid of the mouse,
and get your act together now.

38
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:24,191
He's grumpy.

<i>Okay, detectives,
let's get started.</i>

42
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:50,689
Santiago, where are we
with the Jay street drug bust?

43
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:52,706
There are 12 keys of coke
unaccounted for,

44
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,436
but we just got a warrant to
search the dealer's apartment.

45
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,164
Good.
Take Boyle and Diaz.

00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,861
Dream team.

47
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:00,807
Peralta, brief us
on the vandalism case.

48
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,471
Well, there's no easy way
to put this, sarge,

49
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,290
but someone has been painting
wieners on squad cars.

50
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,570
[Laughter]

51
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,332
<i>And apparently,
they won't stop</i>

52
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,997
until there's a penis drawn
on every cop car in Brooklyn.

53
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,720
Oh, that's what
he's been drawing.

54
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,961
But what are those little
round things at the bottom?

55
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:15,922
That's the butt.

56
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:17,620
The butt?

57
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,343
I assume you have a plan
to catch this gentleman.

58
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,297
Did you just
say "genital-man"?

59
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,700
Because if so, kudos,
and yes, I have a plan.

60
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,073
I'm gonna plant
a decoy squad car as bait.

61
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,915
Meanwhile, I'll be waiting
in an undercover vehicle here.

62
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,510
He's already tagged
three U/C vehicles.

63
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,105
He can clearly spot 'em.
You should take my minivan.

64
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,902
- A minivan?
- A-ha!

65
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,247
[Laughter]

66
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:42,609
You all got a problem
with my minivan?

67
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,915
'Cause my wife
doesn't like it either.

68
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,931
She wanted an SUV,
but those things roll, man.

69
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,629
They roll!

70
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,197
That's a good idea, sergeant.
We'll take the van.

71
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,765
We?
You're coming with me?

72
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,455
Sir, with all due respect,
I don't need backup.

73
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,014
It's not backup.
It's babysitting.

74
00:02:57,048 --> 00:03:00,149
- Babysitting.
- A-ha!

75
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,110
[Indistinct chatter]

76
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,455
Oh, look at this.

77
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,471
The drug dealer
got a B.A. in art history

78
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:06,072
from Brooklyn college.

79
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,032
Interesting, huh?

80
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,791
How's that interesting?

81
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,162
Well, it's surprising
because you would think

82
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,760
he had studied... drugs.

83
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,524
I studied
art history too.

84
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:17,348
- Also not interesting.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

85
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,587
I know I'm just
a lowly civilian administrator,

86
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,442
but I couldn't
help overhearing

87
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,907
you're looking
for some missing drugs?

88
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,987
As it turns out,
my friend here, Carlene,

89
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:29,253
is a psychic,
and she's ready to help you.

90
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:30,789
I do palms, tarot,

91
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,128
and I have a degree
in numerology from the Internet.

92
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,827
- Ugh.
- Really, Gina?

93
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:36,810
- A psychic?
- What? She's the real deal.

94
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,858
E.G., last week,
she predicted

95
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,389
I would have
a sensuous encounter

96
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,959
with a guy named Mark.

97
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,107
And I did.

98
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,117
[Rock music]

99
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:51,159
Is anyone here
named Mark?

100
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
You're good.

101
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,068
Okay, she's had visions
which, frankly,

102
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,733
science cannot account for.

103
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,230
Also, she can get you
amazing deals

104
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,895
on ladies' footwear.

105
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,966
She's assistant manager
at Leonard's designer shoes.

106
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,360
Vision.
The drugs are in a location.

107
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,154
I see the color blue...
She sees blue.

108
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,658
And yellow.

109
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:14,052
And I see the letter
"L", "R", "S", "T", "W", "E",

110
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,683
and "B."

111
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,698
So basically, everyone's
first eight guesses in hangman?

112
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,457
Thank you, Carlene.

113
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,500
Your entire life
is garbage.

114
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,293
So Holt's coming
on my stakeout now?

115
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,597
I made a mixtape with
some very explicit rap on it,

116
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,423
and now I can't sing along.
You made a mixtape?

117
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:29,735
Yes, I still listen
to cassettes.

118
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,174
This guy is all over me.

119
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,773
I mean, a Captain
on a minor vandalism case?

120
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,023
It's insane.

121
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,881
What's insane
is how you refuse

122
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,162
to get with the program.

123
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,570
There is a new sheriff
in town, Jake.

124
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,361
Well, I like
the old sheriff.

125
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,088
I mean, McGintley wouldn't care
about a messy desk

126
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,592
or all these stupid rules.

127
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,281
(All) Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...
Hey!

128
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:47,625
What the hell's
going on here?

129
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,130
Science experiment.

130
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:51,019
I wanna see what happens
if I taser this cantaloupe.

131
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,366
Okay.

132
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,032
(All)
Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...

133
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,570
Ah!

134
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,878
[All oh]

135
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,633
Yeah!
[Cheers and applause]

136
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,747
And McGintley wouldn't care
if I was three minutes late

137
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:05,565
'cause he was always
an hour late and hungover,

138
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,262
and he would let you do
literally anything you want

139
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,512
if you gave him
a hamburger.

140
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:09,666
Did he let you play
your mixtape?

141
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,332
Okay.
That's very funny.

142
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,669
Get an iPod, man.

143
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,853
Mixtape.

144
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,325
I just want
to apologize

145
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,374
for my fellow
Detective's behavior.

146
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:22,696
Okay, my granny
also had the gift.

147
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,830
I feel
that I will die soon.

148
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,776
She was right.
She died two years later.

149
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:32,457
Your sincere belief in my gift
means a great deal.

150
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,312
Vision.

151
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,425
The woman you love,
the one you work with,

152
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,281
the scary one
with the black hair...

153
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,627
- Rosa.
- Yes?

154
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,971
She doesn't
love you back.

155
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,925
She will never
love you back.

156
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,142
Say "thank you," Charles.

157
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,742
She just told you
your future.

158
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,088
Thank you.

159
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,342
You left without me.
You were late again.

160
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:59,129
Well, I had to put on
my undercover minivan disguise.

161
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,434
Say hello
to Harvey Norgenbloom,

162
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,349
CPA, recently divorced
father of two

163
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,357
with a dark sexual secret.

164
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,599
- What's your cover?
- Angry Captain.

165
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,738
Okay, so you do not like
my ensemble.

166
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,625
I'm just concerned
that you may find it hard

167
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:17,059
to pursue a criminal on foot
while wearing man sandals.

168
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,368
But the sandals
define Harvey.

169
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:22,347
He's a sandals guy.

170
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,107
[Sighs]

171
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,803
Captain, why the babysitting?
Why are you micromanaging me?

172
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,625
You think I wanna be
sitting here with you

173
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:28,810
instead of running
my precinct?

174
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:30,413
Yes.
It was a rhetorical question.

175
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:32,047
I've spent
the last 12 years

176
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,553
fighting
for my first command,

177
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,061
and I'm not gonna
let you screw it up

178
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,823
because you refuse
to take your job seriously.

179
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,128
Hey, I do take
my job seriously.

180
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,889
I put away bad guys.
That's what matters.

181
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,362
Well, so does doing
your paperwork,

182
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,929
showing up on time,
wearing proper footwear.

183
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:45,626
That's on Harvey.
That's not me.

184
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:46,970
Well, so here's
the deal.

185
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,411
You're gonna have
a superior officer

186
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:50,429
babysitting you
on every one of your cases.

187
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,806
And when you show me
that you can do your job...

188
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,851
Every part of your job...
Perfectly,

189
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:57,320
then I'll back off.

190
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,424
Okay.
Counteroffer.

191
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:04,071
I give you 50 bucks, and you
let me do whatever I want.

192
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,987
Fine.
We'll do it your way.

193
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,204
From this point on,
I'll do

194
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,541
every part
of the job perfectly,

195
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,208
perfecter than perfectly.

196
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,931
It's "more perfectly."
You said that imperfectly.

197
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:18,066
I was testing you.
You did perfectly.

198
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,889
Quick update
on the tagger situation...

199
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,832
He is currently spray-painting
our van right now.

200
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,042
Police, freeze!

201
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,866
Ow, ow, ow.

202
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,402
Sandal down.

203
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:30,674
Lost a sandal.
NYPD, freeze!

204
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,009
I'm here.

205
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,447
You're busted.

206
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:35,792
Already got him.
We got him.

207
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:42,421
Oh, hey, Captain.

208
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:46,295
Hi, so I was able to procure
that $50 after all,

209
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:48,023
and my offer
still stands.

210
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,880
Let me do whatever I want,
and the $40...

211
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,026
That's how much
I actually have... is yours.

212
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,526
No? Fair enough.
I only had 30 anyway.

213
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,031
Well, I guess
in order to get you

214
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:57,600
to stop micromanaging me,
I'm gonna have to get back

215
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,809
to the most important piece
of police work there is:

216
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,153
Writing a perfect report.

217
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:02,818
Good, I'm anxious
to read it.

218
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:06,215
And I'm anxious to restore
my status as a lone wolf.

219
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,483
[Howls]

220
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:10,764
Anything else, Detective?

221
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:12,172
Yeah, I'm gonna do
one more.

222
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,542
[Howls]

223
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,527
Lone wolf.

224
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:19,984
He's digging me.

225
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,585
[Clicks tongue]

226
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,665
Hey, sarge, do you know
where we keep the glitter?

227
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,584
Just wanna make sure
this report for the Captain

228
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:26,703
is extra sparkly.

229
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:27,983
What are you doing,
Peralta?

230
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,679
Look, if I have to do things
his way,

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm gonna do them
my way.

232
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,849
[Laughs]
Okay, man.

233
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,931
It was nice working with you.
[Laughs]

234
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,593
I'm not scared of him,
okay?

235
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,125
I'm not scared
of anyone.

236
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:40,853
Oh, also, the tagger drew
a penis on your minivan.

237
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,613
I'm sorry.
Please don't chase after me.

238
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:45,057
What?
There's a penis on my minivan?

239
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,472
High ceilings,
three bedrooms.

240
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,780
Why does every perp
have a nicer place than I do?

241
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,827
You know what they don't
teach you at the academy?

242
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:53,903
It's better to be
a criminal.

243
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,152
Oh, no.
The cabinets are blue.

244
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,883
Tacky.
Not a deal breaker, though.

245
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,196
I'd just repaint it.

246
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,990
The psychic predicted
the drugs

247
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,219
would be found
in something blue.

248
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:06,248
[Slow motion]
I see the color blue.

249
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,170
She also made this really
depressing prediction

250
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,451
about my life.

251
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:12,365
[Slow motion]
She will never love you back.

252
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,994
And if she's right
about where we find the drugs,

253
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,146
that means she's right
about the other thing.

254
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,323
- Uh-huh.
- Kitchen.

255
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,257
- Whoa.
- Jackpot.

256
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,373
There's way more
than 12 keys in here.

257
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,493
Where was it?

258
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,191
Baseboard,
behind the hamper.

259
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:29,952
What color
was the hamper?

260
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:30,911
- <i>Green.</i>
- Yes.

261
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,191
The clothes hamper
was green.

262
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,139
The clothes hamper was green!

263
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,869
Drinks on me.

264
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,724
[Laughs]
You're weird.

265
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,518
[Engine starts]

266
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,079
Sorry this is
taking so long.

267
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,232
Still writing up
my report.

268
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,866
Pretty detailed.

269
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,979
Hey, Gina, can you look up
what the humidity was

270
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,285
about an hour ago and also
what moon cycle we're in?

271
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:53,456
No, sorry.
Don't feel like it, no.

272
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,530
Thanks, Gina.

273
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,292
And now to you.
What's your name?

274
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,085
My name is
banana fartman, md.

275
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,399
I don't believe you.

276
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,448
Come on, man.
Just tell me who you are.

277
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,728
I need to fill
this thing out perfectly,

278
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,425
so my boss
will get off my back.

279
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,707
Are you a minor?
How old are you?

280
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,564
I'm 610.
I'm a highlander.

281
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,357
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put that in there.

282
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:13,502
And then you're gonna be tried
as an adult highlander.

283
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,615
And they're gonna cut
your head off.

284
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,769
Is that what you want?

285
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:18,948
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

286
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,031
but your psychic
friend's predictions

287
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:22,634
about the drug case
were wrong,

288
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,622
which means all
of her predictions are wrong.

289
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,599
Mm-mm. No way.
She's never wrong.

290
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,551
We found the cocaine
behind a green hamper.

291
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,506
Never said green
or the letter "H."

292
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,488
Mm-hmm, she said
"blue" and "yellow," Charles.

293
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:36,632
I don't know if there's
any kindergarteners present,

294
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,970
but those two colors combined
make green.

295
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,621
She also mentioned
the letters "L" and "B,"

296
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,825
and another name
for a hamper is...

297
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,740
Lady bin?

298
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:49,797
Laundry basket.

299
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,464
Oh, little boo-boo.

300
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,771
Can you go be depressed
over there?

301
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,172
You're bumming out
my whole area.

302
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:58,316
Baby, I've got
some bad news.

303
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:02,991
Someone painted a giant penis
on our minivan.

304
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:05,648
No, you cannot have
an SUV now.

305
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,954
Those things roll, baby.
They roll!

306
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:10,036
Hey, look at this.

307
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,863
Your prints were
on file.

308
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,909
Nice to meet you,
Trevor Podolski.

309
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,968
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

310
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:23,876
Your father is deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

311
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:26,247
I'm not sure
how things work here,

312
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:29,194
but does that mean
that your career is in my hands?

313
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:31,821
Okay, you know what?

314
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:32,943
Yes.

315
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,893
20.2 kilos.

316
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:40,142
I feel like
we could round up to 21.

317
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:43,408
Or we could round down
to 20,

318
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,930
take the extra 0.2,
sell it to our friends.

319
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:50,519
[Giggles]

320
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,696
I'll call the D.A.
Rosa, you log this in.

321
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:54,233
Charles, maybe watch Gina.

322
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,354
[Laughs]

323
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,507
So what are
you doing tonight?

324
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,358
Nothing.
What about you...

325
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,640
Are doing tonight?

326
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,365
Nothing.

327
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,678
Carlene.

328
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,000
Whelp, I hope you find
something to do.

329
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,730
[Chuckles]

330
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,964
I'm gonna pee.
That's what I'm doing tonight.

331
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,301
No.

332
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,647
[Sighs]

333
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,176
Deputy commissioner's son, huh?
[Sighs]

334
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,897
His decision to target cop cars
makes a lot more sense now.

335
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:24,208
We gotta let him walk,
right?

336
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,776
He defaced
nine police vehicles,

337
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,024
and you caught him
red-handed.

338
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,974
Why would you let him walk?
[Chuckles]

339
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,758
Captain, I did all the work
on this perfectly.

340
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,703
I mean, my report
has over 25 pages

341
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,427
of meticulous research,
diagrams, and maps.

342
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:40,215
I even put an "about the author"
section on the back.

343
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,586
I did everything
you asked me to do,

344
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:43,994
but this is
above my pay grade.

345
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,467
You gotta make the call.

346
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:48,796
You're the arresting officer.
It's your call.

347
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,909
I told you to do
every part of your job,

348
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,279
and making this call
is part of your job.

349
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,643
- Yeah, but you think I should process him.
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,308
Well, if I do,
the deputy commissioner

351
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,781
could ruin my career,
and I'll end up on the streets

352
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,607
selling my beautiful body
for a can of beans.

353
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,241
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,252
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like a statue?

355
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,565
Yes.

356
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:11,119
Man, you were totally right
about the cocaine,

357
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,977
and you were also right
about Rosa.

358
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:14,642
Who's Rosa?
The woman I...

359
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,530
The woman who doesn't
love him back.

360
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,939
Oh.
Yes, that woman.

361
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,636
You know, it can be a burden
to always know

362
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,076
what's gonna happen
in the future.

363
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,581
Don't get out
of the chair.

364
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,888
I just had a vision
of you leaving this chair

365
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,457
and getting
seriously injured.

366
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:27,929
Oh, my God.

367
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,976
I should probably wheel you
back to your desk.

368
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,025
That is a great idea.
Wheel you off a bridge.

369
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,466
[Laughs]
I'm kidding.

370
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,704
â™ª Oh, you're alone

371
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:38,107
â™ª Uh-oh, you're alone
for life â™ª

372
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,030
So here are my options.

373
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,527
One, I process
Podolski's kid,

374
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,224
he fires me, and I spend
the rest of my career

375
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,947
as a Detective, third grade,
which is literally pathetic.

376
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:49,608
No offense, Hitchcock.
None taken.

377
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,723
Option two,
I let him walk,

378
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:52,908
and I spend the rest
of my life with Holt

379
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,765
as my babysitter.

380
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,526
Honestly, when I think about
spending the rest of my life

381
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:57,966
with a babysitter,

382
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,304
she's kind of a cute blonde
named Erica,

383
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:01,714
and she always has
pizza money

384
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,028
and lets me stay up as late
as I want.

385
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,567
How old are you
in this scenario?

386
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,553
Anyway, the point is
Holt cares more

387
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,019
about whether I
"do my job right"

388
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,653
than whether I have a job
at all.

389
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:11,967
So I'm taking suggestions.

390
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:13,761
I say piss off Holt,

391
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,682
so we get to watch your career
end right in front of us.

392
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:17,443
Okay, thank you
for that, Santiago.

393
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,853
I'm gonna put you down
for "don't arrest,"

394
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:20,294
and I'm also going
to put your phone number

395
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:21,736
on every urinal
in Rikers.

396
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,106
Don't arrest him.
Just smack him. Hard.

397
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:25,515
With a phone book
on a body part

398
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:26,954
no one can see,
you know what I'm saying?

399
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:28,779
So you're suggesting
police brutality?

400
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,893
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah.
Why?

401
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,814
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

402
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,321
You want this collar?
Paperwork's all done,

403
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,883
and it's perfect.
The Podolski kid?

404
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,643
Are you kidding?
I just gave him my lunch.

405
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,397
Okay.
Boyle, what do you think?

406
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,445
I don't know, man.
I'm lost.

407
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:45,460
The universe is
a cruel and vexing puzzle.

408
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:47,699
I-I'm at the whim
of the cosmos.

409
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,327
All right, I'm gonna put
you down for "bummer,"

410
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:54,680
and you can hang out in
that category all by yourself.

411
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,313
Hey, everyone.

412
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,930
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy,
angry official here,

413
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,691
deputy commissioner Podolski.

414
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,350
He's asking for you.
Very angry.

415
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:08,000
Elderly, sexy, furious.

416
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,201
Well, my career
is over.

417
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,696
See you at the bottom,
Hitchcock. No offense.

418
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:16,669
No, none taken.

419
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,293
Deputy commissioner.

420
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,349
Where's my son?

421
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,950
He is at my desk,

422
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,354
enjoying a nice glass
of bubbly water

423
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,501
and some chocolate I was saving
for a special occasion.

424
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:28,104
Hey, Peralta,
when you're done,

425
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,187
can you help me wrap up
this massive cocaine bust

426
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,684
I just pulled off?
Thanks.

427
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:35,149
Oh, deputy commissioner,
didn't see you there.

428
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,686
Sorry for interrupting.

429
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,286
Amy Santiago.

430
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,791
[Sighs]

431
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,873
Trevor, what'd you do
this time?

432
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,058
Nothing.

433
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,204
There you have it.
He said he did nothing.

434
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:47,733
So I caught him red-handed
doing nothing?

435
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:48,692
I'm saying maybe
it's a possibility

436
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,099
you made a mistake.

437
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,508
You know, normally,
I would agree with you,

438
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,334
but I've been
pretty detail-oriented

439
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,391
the last few hours.

440
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,866
You might not
understand this,

441
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,206
but Trevor is
a special kid.

442
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,829
He makes straight "A"s.
He's going to Duke next year.

443
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,846
Lacrosse scholarship.
Oh.

444
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,505
Sometimes, boys
just need to be boys.

445
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,486
You do realize
he did thousands of dollars

446
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,439
worth of property damage,
though,

447
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,008
to police vehicles.

448
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,896
Look, I think
we can all agree

449
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,914
that I'm ordering you
to let this slide

450
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:17,485
because nothing happened.

451
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:19,408
This is officially
out of your hands.

452
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,709
Would you actually mind
just checking out my report?

453
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,862
It's pretty thorough,

454
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:26,262
and I spent over an hour
on fonts.

455
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:27,381
Kinda snazzy, so...

456
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,109
Oh, thank you.

457
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,229
I'll get right to it.

458
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,310
Thanks.
Trevor, let's go.

459
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:34,904
Have a good one.

460
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,487
Choo.

461
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:44,544
Yes.

462
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,113
What's up with the chair?

463
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:49,442
Um, Carlene predicted
if I get out of this chair,

464
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,683
I'd get badly hurt,
so I'm not chancing it.

465
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:55,460
Oh, man.
There's no pudding cups left.

466
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:57,573
Ah!
What'd you do that for?

467
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:00,805
There.
Now you're hurt <i>in</i> this chair.

468
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:02,214
You can get hurt anywhere,
Boyle.

469
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,976
And if you do,
it won't be

470
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:07,756
because some shoe salesman
predicted it.

471
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,673
You make
your own destiny.

472
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:17,746
Well, we don't have to worry
about Podolski's son anymore.

473
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,571
The case is officially
out of my hands.

474
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,691
No charges filed.

475
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,230
Why is there yogurt
on this?

476
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:23,895
The deputy commissioner
threw my report

477
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,560
in Terry's trash can,

478
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,159
and he'd been eating
yogurt earlier.

479
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,007
Terry loves yogurt.

480
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,313
Something wrong?
Kinda, yeah.

481
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:33,980
I called six precincts
about this kid.

482
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,710
He's been brought in
a dozen times.

483
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:37,664
Theft, vandalism,
drunken disorderly,

484
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,040
but he's never
been processed.

485
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,759
His daddy comes in
and bails him out every time.

486
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,071
He's a lucky little jerk.

487
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,638
No, I wouldn't say
he was lucky.

488
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,142
I feel bad for this kid.

489
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,031
I mean,
what kind of father

490
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,344
cares so little
for his son

491
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,515
that he lets him get away
with everything?

492
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,404
Well, he's someone else's
problem now.

493
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:58,052
Like you said,
it's out of your hands.

494
00:17:58,053 --> 00:17:59,013
All right, I see
what you're trying to do,

495
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,610
but it's not gonna work.

496
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,372
I'm not going to arrest him.
I'm going to arrest him!

497
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,646
- You want backup?
- Yes.

498
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,688
[Siren wails]

499
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,501
What is this?
You can't do this.

500
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:12,910
Get that thing
outta here.

501
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,222
Excuse me, sir.

502
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,176
Trevor Podolski,
you're under arrest

503
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,842
for vandalism
and destruction of property.

504
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,219
What... dad!
What are you doing?

505
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,373
I told you
to back off, Peralta.

506
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,458
First off,
the name's Santiago,

507
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,412
Detective Amy Santiago.

508
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:26,236
Second, I'm arresting
your son,

509
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,653
which, as I say it aloud,
seems like an unwise choice,

510
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,414
but it's the one
I'm making.

511
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,528
Once again,
my name is Amy Santiago.

512
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,709
You're being stupid, Peralta.
Don't be stupid.

513
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,470
I can make
your life miserable.

514
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:41,129
Commissioner, please don't talk
to my Detective in that Tone.

515
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,633
If you have a complaint,
you can take it up with me.

516
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,121
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, Holt.

517
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:48,746
I'm gonna be watching you,
both of you, like a hawk.

518
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:49,802
You're gonna have to try
a little harder

519
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:51,276
if you wanna scare me.

520
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,485
I've been an openly gay cop
since 1987,

521
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:56,430
so you're not the first
superior officer to threaten me.

522
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,191
You know
how I'm still standing here?

523
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,016
'Cause I do my job,

524
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:02,515
and I do it right.

525
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,861
Damn, son!

526
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:05,750
Don't say "son."
Sorry.

527
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:07,415
Deputy commissioner,
if you wanna pick Trevor up,

528
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,168
he'll be
at the nine-nine.

529
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,437
Let's go, fartman.

530
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,735
Carlene was wrong, Gina.

531
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,330
Rosa said it herself...
I'm in charge of my own destiny.

532
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,933
That means she wants me
to make a move.

533
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,015
Mm, but Carlene
was also right.

534
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:24,353
You did get hurt
'cause Rosa punched you.

535
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,952
And the fact that Rosa
punched you

536
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:27,297
means she does not
like you.

537
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,952
No, no, she punched me
to prove Carlene wrong.

538
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,872
Move.

539
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,185
Oh, wait,
I take it back.

540
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,913
She definitely is
into you.

541
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,924
So much chemistry.
I know, it's crazy.

542
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,398
All right, let's get
this meeting started.

543
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,520
<i>I'm not late.
I'm here.</i>

544
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:44,367
[Alarm beeping]

545
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:50,197
Right on time.

546
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,054
You're out of uniform,
Peralta.

547
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:54,041
Baby steps, Captain.

548
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,747
Baby steps.

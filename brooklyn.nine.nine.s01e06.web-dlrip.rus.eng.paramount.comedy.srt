1
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:03,433
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>- Whoa!</i>

2
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:04,618
Settle.

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,220
Sorry, sarge.

4
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:09,197
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.

5
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:11,118
Everyone's drunk,
wearing a mask,

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,752
and carrying a fake gun.

7
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,769
Plus all the girls think
they have to dress sexy.

8
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,650
I know, that is the worst.
Please make them stop.

9
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,092
I passed a slutty tree
on the way here.

10
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,822
Who wants to have sex
with a tree?

11
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,101
Was it a maple?

12
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:23,510
Was it a maple?

13
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,463
<i>Buon giorno, buon giorno.</i>

14
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:28,025
- Pretty cool 'stume, huh?
- 'Stume?

15
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:29,562
Short for costume. Ah.

16
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,739
All right, let me guess.
You are dumpy Chuck Norris.

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,988
No, I'm... Dumpy Ron Weasley.

18
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,237
No.

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:35,646
<i>You guys, stop it.</i>

20
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,311
He put thought
into his costume,

21
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:39,937
and he is obviously Miranda
from <i>Sex and the City.</i>

22
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:41,089
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!

23
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,524
"Molto Mario"? Celebrity chef?

24
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,028
Ginger Prince of little Italy?

25
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,853
Is he also
a homeless troll doll?

26
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,101
'Cause you look like
a homeless troll doll.

27
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,216
Hey, sweet Batali costume,
dude.

28
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,688
Thank you!

29
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,226
There's a man
with impeccable taste.

30
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,491
He bit a guy's butt off
at a W.N.B.A. game.

31
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:57,676
Eric Stoltz from <i>Mask</i>.

32
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,342
I'll take it. <i>Yeah.</i>

33
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,423
I hope you're all well rested.

34
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:03,120
It's gonna be a busy night.

35
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,273
The holding cell's
completely full.

36
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,745
I keep having to separate

37
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,140
Hillary Clinton
and Kim Jong-Un.

38
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,428
Stop it! Stop making out!

39
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:12,086
Hey... no! What would bill say?

40
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,528
<i>We need two undercovers</i>

41
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,968
at the Dekalb street
warehouse party.

42
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,593
Boyle, you're already
in costume as, uh,

43
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:18,810
Joy Behar?

44
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,963
I'm Mario Batali.

45
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:21,949
Okay. And, uh, Santiago,

46
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,134
you go with him.

47
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,214
Yes, sir. Damn it.

48
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:27,776
Santiago, I know
that you hate Halloween,

49
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:29,409
but stick with me,
and I promise you,

50
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,787
you will love it.

51
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,004
Can you magically make everyone
kind, sober,

52
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:33,220
and fully dressed?

53
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:34,820
"Kind, sober,
and fully dressed."

54
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,134
Good news, everyone,
we found the name

55
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:38,215
of Santiago's sex tape.

56
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,111
Well, ring it up, nerds.

57
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,032
I just arrested
my first Halloween idiot

58
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,249
of the season.

59
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,561
He was trying to rob a bank

60
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,516
but had a little trouble
with the getaway.

61
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,950
Trying to "split," huh?

62
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,638
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
get out on "a peel."

63
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm so glad you're stuck.

64
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,361
I've got a million of these.

65
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:17,226
No, no, don't touch the money!
<i>Ugh!</i>

66
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,882
I swear,
these perps are so stupid.

67
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:20,323
I'd make a better criminal
than any of them.

68
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,052
Yeah, you would.
You'd be an evil mastermind,

69
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,814
and everyone would call you
the handsome bandit.

70
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:25,672
<i>Thank you, Charles.
And the best part is,</i>

71
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,625
none of you could catch me.

72
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,186
I'm fairly certain
you would be caught.

73
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:31,404
<i>No, scratch that.</i>

74
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,614
I'm 100% sure you'd be caught.

75
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,181
Ho, ho, ho!

76
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,591
All right, challenge accepted.

77
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,065
I didn't issue a challenge.
Fine.

78
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,633
I'll issue it for you.

79
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,010
What's the most valuable thing
in your office?

80
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,322
My medal of valor.

81
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,731
God, you are such a hero.

82
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,620
All right, how about this?
I will bet you

83
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,222
that by midnight tonight,

84
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:48,984
I can steal the medal of valor
from your office.

85
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,224
<i>Why would I possibly
agree to that?</i>

86
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,537
Because if I lose, I'll work

87
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,722
the next five weekends,
no overtime.

88
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,068
And I won't tell anyone here

89
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:56,380
about the time I saw you
wearing short shorts

90
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,565
outside of work.

91
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,845
But if I win... You won't.

92
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,351
You have to do all
of my paperwork tonight,

93
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:03,489
the busiest and spookiest night
of the year.

94
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,922
And you have to publicly state

95
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,765
that I'm an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

96
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,847
And this won't interfere
with you doing your job?

97
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,401
You mean my job as an amazing
Detective-slash-genius?

98
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,649
No, it will not.
I'll do all of my work,

99
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,803
guaranteed.

100
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,372
I'm considering it.

101
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,620
I'm interested.

102
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,021
I agree to participate.
All right.

103
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,489
There's the robot
I fell in love with.

104
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,768
<i>Hey.</i>

105
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,466
Sister Steve here got mugged.

106
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:29,810
Some guy dressed
as the royal baby

107
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,828
punched him
and took his wallet.

108
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,173
She keeps laughing at me.

109
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,550
Can't tell you how many nuns

110
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,830
I wanted to beat up
in catholic school.

111
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,175
Ten.

112
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,041
I didn't know you went
to catholic school.

113
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,634
Good. You shouldn't know it.

114
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,259
I get it.
You're so mysterious and tough.

115
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,684
But you know what I think?

116
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,301
You're actually a big softy.

117
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:47,766
No, I think she's really mean.

118
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,184
You probably read
a Maya angelou poem

119
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,968
at your graduation and cried.

120
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,578
Didn't graduate. Had to leave.

121
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,858
Why? What'd you do?

122
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,556
Here's a hint.

123
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:58,022
I'm not gonna tell you.

124
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,807
Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.

125
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,993
I'm a Detective.

126
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,362
I will detect!

127
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:05,707
Hey.

128
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,371
Got an arrest file here
for the Captain.

129
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,717
Drunk and disorderly.

130
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,478
So, anyways...

131
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,887
Gina!

132
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,296
We never talk anymore.

133
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:14,864
How's the dance troupe?
Did you get a haircut?

134
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:16,209
What's the Captain's
schedule like today?

135
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:18,067
I'm not gonna help you
rob him, Jake.

136
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,084
I'm his assistant,
and I take that job

137
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,709
incredibly seriously.

138
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:22,934
You're literally making
paper airplanes

139
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,599
out of police reports
right now.

140
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,201
Well, how am I supposed to get
it into that garbage can?

141
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,417
<i>Please, Gina?</i>

142
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,923
Fine, Captain's got a meeting

143
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,779
downstairs in ten minutes.

144
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,500
You're the best. Mwah!

145
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,814
What does your skin taste like?

146
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:36,864
Dina Lohan.
I'm wearing her face lotion.

147
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,624
That's it.

148
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,385
Thank you.

149
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:42,243
Okay, party's
around the corner.

150
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,549
Tipster said there'll be
a huge amount of drug activity.

151
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,853
Why is this costume so stiff?

152
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,744
And what is that smell?

153
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,473
The department never washes
them, so it's probably vomit.

154
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:51,657
Hey!

155
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,674
I got you a chocolate.

156
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:56,269
Yet another great thing
about Halloween... chocolate!

157
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,190
Thanks. Oh, look.

158
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,270
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka
right from the bottle.

159
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,904
<i>People think
if they put on a costume,</i>

160
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,305
<i>they can just get away
with anything they want.</i>

161
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:07,219
Halloween is Christmas
for jerks.

162
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,237
Come on, ma'am.
No open containers.

163
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,920
Oh, and why should I listen
to you, bone person?

164
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,482
It's called skelon.
It's a very common word.

165
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,922
Just put the vodka away.

166
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,139
<i>You guys are cops?</i>

167
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
These guys are cops!

168
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,212
Are you in my ceiling, Peralta?

169
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,908
<i>No.</i>

170
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,285
So what's the plan?

171
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,533
You wait for me
to leave my office,

172
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,847
lower yourself down,
take my medal,

173
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:37,033
and win the bet?

174
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,249
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

175
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,962
<i>There's no one up here.</i>

176
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,514
Peralta, just so you know,

177
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,077
right now, I am taking
my medal off the wall

178
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,999
and placing it in a locked safe

179
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,766
whose combination is known
only to me.

180
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,648
The safe, in turn,

181
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,185
is locked in the cabinet.

182
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,444
The only key to that cabinet
is on my person.

183
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,717
I'm off to my meeting.
Good luck with your plan.

184
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>You think that scares me?</i>

185
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:03,033
<i>I laugh in the face
of adversity!</i>

186
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,665
<i>Are you still there?</i>

187
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,043
<i>Captain, are you still there?
I can't hear...</i>

188
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:08,445
Agh!

189
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,167
<i>Ow.</i>

190
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,654
Here you go.

191
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,183
Don't touch the butter.

192
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:17,687
What happened?
I thought you guys

193
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:18,904
were supposed to be
at the warehouse party.

194
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,218
We got egged.

195
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,850
Some of the shell
got in my contacts

196
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:24,317
and my hair and my mouth
and my bra.

197
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,533
I can't tell
if that's hot or not.

198
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:26,749
Not hot.

199
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,934
Eggshell in my bra is not hot.

200
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:29,151
Well, it's kinda hot.

201
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:32,194
Boobs go in a bra. Up top.

202
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,275
Whoo! My man.

203
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,260
Well, it sounds like
costume duty is going great.

204
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,637
So great.
We're having the best time.

205
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:38,790
Right, Amy?

206
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,519
I wish I was dead. <i>Hmm.</i>

207
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:42,119
How's the unwinnable bet going?

208
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,401
Well, on the one hand,
I fell through the ceiling

209
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,162
and onto a pencil,
but on the other hand,

210
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,796
I also badly bruised my brain.

211
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,107
If you wanted to make
a bet with Holt,

212
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,389
you shoulda made a bet
you could win.

213
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,959
Like who wears
more denim jackets.

214
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,527
That was one time.

215
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,129
You guys never forget anything.

216
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,409
You know, frankly,
I'm a little surprised

217
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,818
you don't think
I can win this thing.

218
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,418
You're always telling me
how I'm the best.

219
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,436
You're the best, Jake.

220
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,096
Paperwork delivery.

221
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,350
You're the best, Jake.

222
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,239
Jake, you're the best.

223
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,937
Thank you, Charles.

224
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,410
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.

225
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,172
<i>Look, Jake,</i>

226
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:12,123
I love you like you're one of my daughters.
Really?

227
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,270
But it's not about you
or how smart you are.

228
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,454
It's about Captain Holt.

229
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,959
The man's a genius.

230
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,432
He's had your number
at every turn.

231
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:22,435
Well, not this day...
Turn... time.

232
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,477
Sorry, I'm pretty sure
I had a concussion back there.

233
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,725
Here I come. All right.

234
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,024
Ohh, strong. Ahh.

235
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:31,913
<i>Okay, here's the first set</i>

236
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,515
<i>of royal babies I rounded up.</i>

237
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,700
Popular costume.

238
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,915
Any of these guys
look familiar?

239
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,389
Maybe the third guy.

240
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:38,926
The baby who mugged me
was pretty short.

241
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,361
You're not supposed
to laugh at me.

242
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,800
<i>Number three,</i>

243
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,370
step forward and say,
"give me your money,

244
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,682
you stupid bag of crap."

245
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:48,405
Gimme your money,
you stupid bag of crap.

246
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,717
No, wrong giant baby.

247
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,966
I still want to know
why you got kicked out

248
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,471
of catholic school.

249
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,976
Were you doing drugs?

250
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:56,698
Worse. Selling drugs?

251
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,900
Worse.
How bad could it have been?

252
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,494
Did you burn down a church?

253
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,247
Number three, step forward
and say the word

254
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,496
"worse."

255
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,090
Worse.

256
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:10,820
Excuse me, Gina.

257
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,101
I can't find Peralta anywhere,
and you're the only one

258
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,704
who can decipher
his handwriting.

259
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,262
He arrested that bunny,
but I don't know what for.

260
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,144
He's either a crispy
mother werewolf

261
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,899
or cowboy mustard,
oslo, Norway.

262
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:23,307
Hmm.

263
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,350
The bunny groped multiple women
on the subway.

264
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,784
Being able to read
Jake's writing is a gift.

265
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,832
A useless, useless gift.

266
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,676
<i>Excuse me one second.</i>

267
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,724
Nice costume, Peralta.

268
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,486
No Peralta here.

269
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:41,913
Just a normal janitor
pushing trash around.

270
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,545
Come out of there.

271
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,907
Captain, hey.

272
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,093
You really thought
this was gonna work?

273
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,310
Uh, it did work.

274
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,527
This whole janitor gambit

275
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,256
was designed to fail.

276
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,472
It's just like in chess.

277
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:54,849
Sometimes in order to win,

278
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,290
you have to sacrifice
your king.

279
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,956
That's exactly how
you lose in chess.

280
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,204
Have you ever played the game?

281
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,580
Yeah, I used to play
with my uncle Bob

282
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,342
all the time,
and he said I was great.

283
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,455
This is a game
of concentration, Jake.

284
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:07,369
So focus your mind,
and start shooting.

285
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,294
Now you're a master
of chess, huh?

286
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:14,606
He taught me how to shoot
backgammon too.

287
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:15,951
I expected better of you.

288
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:17,168
You could have at least
created a diversion

289
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,058
to distract me
from your terrible costume.

290
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,626
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.

291
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,131
I had a diversion planned.

292
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:24,853
There was just
a slight timing issue.

293
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:26,263
Oh, my God!

294
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:28,344
Get down, everyone!
There's a big fire!

295
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,008
Captain, you better head
over there for, like,

296
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,282
15 minutes and see what's
going on with that.

297
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:35,164
Beware of the back draft.
I'll be in your office.

298
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,551
You have beautiful eyes.

299
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,767
<i>Have it your way.</i>

300
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,593
But you're gonna need this.

301
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,771
And... that.

302
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,396
It's filthy in there.

303
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,601
Come on, Amy! Loosen up!

304
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,850
You look like such a cop!

305
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:58,251
Come on, have some fun,
you know?

306
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,460
It'll help you blend in!

307
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:01,678
Whoo!

308
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,175
Stop trying to get me
to love Halloween.

309
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:05,745
It'll never work.

310
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:06,961
I'm backing it up.

311
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:09,619
Oh, God, please don't.

312
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,733
Hey, heads up.

313
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,950
I'll cut 'em off at the exit.
Okay.

314
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,895
Move! Move, move!

315
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:17,271
He ditched the drugs.
I'm on it.

316
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,649
Ugh.

317
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,140
Oof, everything
is sticking to me.

318
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,421
Ooh.

319
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,277
Ay, h. Yes.

320
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,199
<i>Hey, watch out, man.</i>

321
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,121
Ugh! What is that?

322
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:33,187
How is it hot <i>and</i> cold?

323
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,101
So the soonest you can fix
the ceiling is Monday?

324
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:45,003
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

325
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,413
Wait, stop scratching me.

326
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:47,567
We're supposed to be a team.

327
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,198
Ahem.

328
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,511
Captain, hi.

329
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,041
<i>I was just photocopying
some stuff.</i>

330
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:54,736
Are you trying to jam pigeons
into my air-conditioning vent

331
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,922
to flush me out of my office?

332
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,131
Way to ruin the surprise.

333
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,437
How did you get those birds?
<i>By using my big, fat brain.</i>

334
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,134
Get in the bag, you damn bird.

335
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,319
Eat the bread. Eat the bread!

336
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,856
I gotcha! I gotcha!

337
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,610
All part of my elaborate plan
to defeat you.

338
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,884
So far, you and
your big, fat brain

339
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,708
are losing... badly.

340
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,855
Maybe, if we're talking
about who's winning our bet.

341
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,192
But if we're talking
about who's holding more birds,

342
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm winning, four-nothing.

343
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:21,027
You're only holding two.

344
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:24,262
Yeah.

345
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,036
Ooh, when you were
logging in the drugs,

346
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,382
you missed some awesome stuff.

347
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,399
Guy walked by in full
astronaut costume,

348
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,616
gave me a high five.

349
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:34,696
He high-fived me too.

350
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:35,946
Wait... Hitchcock?

351
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,387
Darn it.

352
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,603
I wasn't supposed to talk,
but I got so excited

353
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:39,821
about that astronaut.

354
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:41,389
What is happening?

355
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:42,670
Amy paid me 50 bucks
to trade places with her

356
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:43,888
for the rest of the night.

357
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,200
Really? Yeah.

358
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,113
I'm gonna use that money
to buy two suits.

359
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,308
Well, I was gonna ask you
to tell the Captain

360
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,751
that I brought in royal babies
for Diaz,

361
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,543
but I'm sure he already knows,

362
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:56,759
since he's always one step
ahead of me.

363
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,912
Aww.

364
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,546
<i>Why so down, little clown?</i>

365
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,763
<i>I'm just sick of losing
to Holt.</i>

366
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:01,915
<i>I want that medal.</i>

367
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,324
It's not real gold.

368
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:05,534
I tried selling it online.
Zero bids.

369
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,840
But here's some advice
I gave to the girls

370
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:10,099
in my dance troupe at the "dance
till you drop" tournament.

371
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,282
That advice was, dance. Dance!

372
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:14,885
<i>Dance.</i>

373
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,607
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that applies here, Gina.

374
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,591
It does apply.
It means don't give up.

375
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,152
We would've won if
Natasha's water hadn't broken.

376
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,010
Oh, Natasha had her baby?
You know Natasha?

377
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,195
Yeah. Yeah.

378
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,412
Her dog has lupus.

379
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,140
Yeah. That's a trip.

380
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:30,062
Small world. Yes.

381
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:34,737
All right, I'm gonna go cry.

382
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,466
I kind of feel bad for him.

383
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,619
<i>Don't.</i>

384
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:39,284
He brought this on himself.

385
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:43,414
You can hang up now.

386
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,273
You paid money to get
out of working with me?

387
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,258
Charles, I had to.
Tonight has been awful.

388
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,947
Halloween is the worst,
and I don't understand

389
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:51,260
why you like it.

390
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,669
No, all the things
that you think are bad

391
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,911
about Halloween
are what make it great.

392
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:56,351
The big kids egg you.

393
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:59,105
Then you and your friends
run away together.

394
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,995
Friendships are forged
in the crucible

395
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,300
of Halloween adversity.

396
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,054
That's all I wanted for us.

397
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:10,730
You can keep the wig.
I don't need it anymore.

398
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:13,707
I don't really need it either.

399
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,988
<i>Hey, Captain Holt,</i>

400
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:18,671
<i>can you come out here
for one sec?</i>

401
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,092
You need something, Peralta?
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

402
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:30,006
Hit it, royal babies.

403
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,525
What... no!

404
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:42,718
Give me my keys.

405
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,351
Will you stop catching me?

406
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:46,112
Do you have any idea how much
I spent on key chains?

407
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:47,586
$23.

408
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,932
Wow, that is
unbelievably close.

409
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,308
22.76.

410
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:52,837
Keys. Okay, look.

411
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:54,214
Tonight has been
a little humiliating.

412
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,624
Things are not going well,

413
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,161
so I'm gonna just
throw this out there.

414
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,539
What do you say
we call off the bet

415
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,882
and pretend this whole thing
never happened?

416
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,323
Oh, I'm not letting you
off the hook.

417
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,956
What? No. Pfft.

418
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,711
I meant to give you an out,
so you could save face.

419
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,599
This is getting sad.

420
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,263
Yeah, for you.

421
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,105
So.

422
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,972
I called your school.

423
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:18,615
And I managed to get a hold
of one sister Bernadette.

424
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,017
I remember that old bag.
She was my favorite.

425
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,297
Well, guess what she said.

426
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:24,378
Apparently, you were
a model student

427
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:27,324
and transferred
of your own volition.

428
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,783
Fine.

429
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,160
The reason I left
catholic school

430
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,274
was because I got into
the american ballet academy.

431
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,227
I was a classical dancer.

432
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,667
And I was good.

433
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,885
I knew it!

434
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:40,581
I knew you were a big softy.

435
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,367
You tell anyone,
I break your face.

436
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:49,611
No, you won't.
You're too sensitive.

437
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:53,166
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

438
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,343
<i>Some officers
just arrested Peralta.</i>

439
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,688
What? <i>They caught him scaling</i>

440
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,514
the side of the building
with a blowtorch.

441
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:04,245
Captain.

442
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,815
Welcome to the endgame.

443
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,288
Would you care to shake
the hand

444
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,824
of the man who defeated you?

445
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,962
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs.
Ohh, that hurt.

446
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,300
Whoo!

447
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,398
Climbing the side of
the building with a blowtorch.

448
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,679
What were you thinking?

449
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,216
I was thinking I had
better core strength.

450
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,401
I got winded, like,
ten feet up.

451
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:24,098
I knew you wouldn't
win the bet,

452
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,474
but your performance tonight
has made me question

453
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:26,884
not only how good
a Detective you are,

454
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,895
but, quite frankly,
how smart you are.

455
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,103
Well, that's not surprising.
You constantly underestimate me.

456
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:35,081
No, you've been
correctly estimated.

457
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:37,419
You have five minutes
until your deadline,

458
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,308
and here you are,
handcuffed to a table,

459
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,622
in a locked room.

460
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,464
Which is precisely
where I planned on being.

461
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,097
Captain, let me tell you
a little story.

462
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,858
You remember when
I fell through your ceiling?

463
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,684
Yes, that was six hours ago.

464
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,733
It was, I admit,
a disastrous failure.

465
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,975
But it gave me the idea
for Herman,

466
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,383
the friendly janitor you met.

467
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,265
With Herman, I commenced
the perfect crime.

468
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,411
I caught you as Herman.

469
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,747
But you didn't catch Rosa.

470
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:06,879
Come out of there.

471
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,063
<i>It turns out that Rosa</i>

472
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,016
<i>is great at picking locks.</i>

473
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,322
Does not surprise me.
No, me neither.

474
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,116
Of course, I had to find a way
to get her out of your office

475
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,428
without you seeing her.

476
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:17,287
<i>So I created a diversion.</i>

477
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:20,135
Not mistimed... Perfectly timed

478
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,608
so she could escape unseen.

479
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:22,857
What about the pigeons?

480
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,299
Oh, the gray pigeons?

481
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,027
<i>They were a red herring.
Thank you.</i>

482
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,980
<i>Their only purpose was
to draw you into the copy room</i>

483
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:31,984
<i>while two members of my team
broke into your locked office.</i>

484
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:32,976
<i>So now I had a way
into your office</i>

485
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,505
<i>and an open cabinet.</i>

486
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:37,267
All that was left was
for the royal babies

487
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,612
to steal your keys.

488
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,501
Yes, but you didn't need
the keys.

489
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,198
The cabinet
was already unlocked.

490
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,511
You needed a way into the safe.

491
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,984
And I got it.

492
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,394
<i>You were so concerned
with getting</i>

493
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:47,611
<i>your keys back,
you didn't even notice</i>

494
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,531
<i>the sergeant steal your phone.</i>

495
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,869
<i>That's right, even
the sergeant is on my side.</i>

496
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,950
<i>I then had Charles dust
your screen cover for prints.</i>

497
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,552
<i>The greasiest smudges revealed</i>

498
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,152
<i>the four numbers
you use the most...</i>

499
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:59,202
The four numbers
in your passcode.

500
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,835
Based on your advanced age,

501
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:03,045
I assumed that you use the same
passcode for everything...

502
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,125
Your phone, your email,
and, of course,

503
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,342
your safe.

504
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,783
That would be
a fair assumption.

505
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,314
It was at that point
that I bumped into a girl

506
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:13,195
dressed as a sexy robot,
and we got our flirt on... hard.

507
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,134
'Sup?

508
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:21,169
'Sup? Jake Peralta.

509
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,769
And how was flirting
part of the plan?

510
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,851
Oh, it wasn't. It just ruled.

511
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,356
And that brings us
to five minutes ago,

512
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:27,605
when Amy came to your office
and told you

513
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:28,982
that I had been arrested.

514
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,295
I knew she's the only one
you would believe

515
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,865
because, frankly,
she's usually too lame

516
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,601
to take part
in these kinds of things.

517
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,481
And as you walked over here,

518
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:36,987
Charles awkwardly stuffed
himself through your window

519
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,389
and opened your safe.

520
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,311
We had the four numbers
of your code, which meant

521
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,423
there were 24 possible
combinations for Charles to try.

522
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,025
That could take
up to four minutes,

523
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,769
which is why I really dragged
out this explanation.

524
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,931
I mean, really stretched it.
I don't know if you noticed,

525
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,435
but there were times
where I was like,

526
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,292
what am I even talking about?
This isn't...

527
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:53,766
Oh.

528
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,424
But now, four minutes is up.

529
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,506
Which means Boyle is either
on the other side of that door

530
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,690
holding your medal,

531
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,668
or I've lost.

532
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,046
Well, Captain,

533
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,487
<i>it seems that Jake</i>

534
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:09,392
isn't the only person
you underestima...

535
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:12,851
20 seconds to spare.
Game over, Captain.

536
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:14,003
Check me.

537
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:15,477
I think you mean "checkmate."

538
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:16,917
You really need to learn
how to play chess.

539
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,288
<i>How did you get everyone
to help you?</i>

540
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,016
I appealed to their sense
of teamwork and camraderie

541
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,418
with a rousing speech that would
put Shakespeare to shame.

542
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:24,635
For too long,

543
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,357
we've been put down, ridiculed,

544
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,182
made to wear ties!

545
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:30,366
But no more!

546
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,616
<i>For today,</i>

547
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,537
we defeat him!

548
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,041
And that worked?
No. No, no. Not at all.

549
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,051
My speech did not inspire them.

550
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,037
Come on. So I bribed them.

551
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:41,799
I told them that if we
pulled this off,

552
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,336
I would do
all of their paperwork.

553
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,513
And since you're doing
all my paperwork...

554
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:47,274
I'm impressed, Peralta.

555
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,556
Well done.

556
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,028
Thank you, sir.

557
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,198
In fact, the thing
that you failed to see, Captain,

558
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,151
<i>teamwork, is exactly...</i>
Captain?

559
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:57,073
<i>What provided our success.</i> Sir?

560
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,922
He's not coming back.

561
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:02,837
<i>Boyle, I need you
in the briefing room.</i>

562
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,689
<i>What is all this?</i>

563
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,290
You know how I think
Halloween is for jerks?

564
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,852
Well, this Halloween,
I was the jerk.

565
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,517
I'm sorry about tonight.

566
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,797
"I'm sorry about tonight."

567
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,207
We found the title

568
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,192
for Santiago's
follow-up sex tape.

569
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,690
I'm sorry I couldn't convince
you to love Halloween.

570
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:24,034
It's not your fault.
I was terrible.

571
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,252
"It's not your fault
I was terrible"

572
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:26,725
is also one of your sex tapes.

573
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:27,974
Ow.

574
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,214
Halloween is unbearable.

575
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:33,098
But it was slightly less
unbearable with you.

576
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,377
Don't. Okay.

577
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,915
Anyway.

578
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,380
We're all going to the bar,
so get changed,

579
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:40,109
'cause you can't be
the only one there

580
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,967
not wearing a 'stume.

581
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,112
'Stume! Oh, my God.
It caught on.

582
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:47,634
No.

583
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:50,389
Ah, Captain Holt.
It is so nice to see you.

584
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,830
Never thought I'd say that.
Hmm.

585
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,878
A poor winner.
I never would've guessed.

586
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:55,384
Yeah, you would've.

587
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:56,793
Way to go all out
on your costume, by the way.

588
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,810
I believe you have
an announcement to make,

589
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,083
so the floor is yours.

590
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,965
Attention, everyone.

591
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:08,289
Jake Peralta is an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

592
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,274
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

593
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,284
I have some paperwork to do.

594
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,590
All right.

595
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,958
Officer in the 92nd got
the royal baby mugger.

596
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,432
He had 19 wallets
in his diaper.

597
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:22,731
<i>We got a runner!</i>

598
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,523
Waahhh!

599
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,733
Damn!

600
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,462
Oh, I didn't tell you.

601
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,767
I got kicked out
of ballet school

602
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:33,968
for beating the crap
out of ballerinas.

603
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,335
It's a good thing we gave 'em a heads up.

604
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,376
Team effort, Go 99.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

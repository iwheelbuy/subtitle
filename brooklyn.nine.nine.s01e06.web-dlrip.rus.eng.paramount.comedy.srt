1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:02,854
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>- Whoa!</i>

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:04,089
Settle.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,757
Sorry, sarge.

4
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:08,860
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.

5
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,862
Everyone's drunk,
wearing a mask,

6
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,564
and carrying a fake gun.

7
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,666
Plus all the girls think
they have to dress sexy.

8
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,669
I know, that is the worst.
Please make them stop.

9
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,171
I passed a slutty tree
on the way here.

10
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:20,973
Who wants to have sex
with a tree?

11
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,306
Was it a maple?

12
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:23,774
Was it a maple?

13
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,809
<i>Buon giorno, buon giorno.</i>

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,479
- Pretty cool 'stume, huh?
- 'Stume?

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
Short for costume. Ah.

16
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,349
All right, let me guess.
You are dumpy Chuck Norris.

17
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,650
No, I'm... Dumpy Ron Weasley.

18
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:34,952
No.

19
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,420
<i>You guys, stop it.</i>

20
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,155
He put thought
into his costume,

21
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:40,891
and he is obviously Miranda
from <i>Sex and the City.</i>

22
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:42,092
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!

23
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,628
"Molto Mario"? Celebrity chef?

24
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,196
Ginger Prince of little Italy?

25
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,098
Is he also
a homeless troll doll?

26
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:49,399
'Cause you look like
a homeless troll doll.

27
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,602
Hey, sweet Batali costume,
dude.

28
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:53,136
Thank you!

29
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,738
There's a man
with impeccable taste.

30
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:58,141
He bit a guy's butt off
at a W.N.B.A. game.

31
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,376
Eric Stoltz from <i>Mask</i>.

32
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,111
I'll take it. <i>Yeah.</i>

33
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,280
I hope you're all well rested.

34
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,048
It's gonna be a busy night.

35
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,250
The holding cell's
completely full.

36
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:07,784
I keep having to separate

37
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,236
Hillary Clinton
and Kim Jong-Un.

38
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,622
Stop it! Stop making out!

39
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,391
Hey... no! What would bill say?

40
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,893
<i>We need two undercovers</i>

41
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:17,394
at the Dekalb street
warehouse party.

42
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,130
Boyle, you're already
in costume as, uh,

43
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,398
Joy Behar?

44
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:22,599
I'm Mario Batali.

45
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,668
Okay. And, uh, Santiago,

46
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,903
you go with him.

47
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:28,071
Yes, sir. Damn it.

48
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:30,741
Santiago, I know
that you hate Halloween,

49
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:32,442
but stick with me,
and I promise you,

50
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:33,877
you will love it.

51
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,145
Can you magically make everyone
kind, sober,

52
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,413
and fully dressed?

53
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,081
"Kind, sober,
and fully dressed."

54
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:39,449
Good news, everyone,
we found the name

55
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,618
of Santiago's sex tape.

56
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,475
Well, ring it up, nerds.

57
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,477
I just arrested
my first Halloween idiot

58
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,745
of the season.

59
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:10,113
He was trying to rob a bank

60
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:12,149
but had a little trouble
with the getaway.

61
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,685
Trying to "split," huh?

62
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:17,487
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
get out on "a peel."

63
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:18,822
I'm so glad you're stuck.

64
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,324
I've got a million of these.

65
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,267
No, no, don't touch the money!
<i>Ugh!</i>

66
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:23,994
I swear,
these perps are so stupid.

67
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,495
I'd make a better criminal
than any of them.

68
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,297
Yeah, you would.
You'd be an evil mastermind,

69
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,132
and everyone would call you
the handsome bandit.

70
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,068
<i>Thank you, Charles.
And the best part is,</i>

71
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,103
none of you could catch me.

72
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:35,772
I'm fairly certain
you would be caught.

73
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,040
<i>No, scratch that.</i>

74
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,343
I'm 100% sure you'd be caught.

75
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,978
Ho, ho, ho!

76
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,446
All right, challenge accepted.

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,981
I didn't issue a challenge.
Fine.

78
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,616
I'll issue it for you.

79
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,050
What's the most valuable thing
in your office?

80
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,418
My medal of valor.

81
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,886
God, you are such a hero.

82
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,855
All right, how about this?
I will bet you

83
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,523
that by midnight tonight,

84
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:55,359
I can steal the medal of valor
from your office.

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,694
<i>Why would I possibly
agree to that?</i>

86
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,062
Because if I lose, I'll work

87
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,297
the next five weekends,
no overtime.

88
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:01,698
And I won't tell anyone here

89
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,066
about the time I saw you
wearing short shorts

90
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,301
outside of work.

91
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,636
But if I win... You won't.

92
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,204
You have to do all
of my paperwork tonight,

93
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,474
the busiest and spookiest night
of the year.

94
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:13,010
And you have to publicly state

95
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:17,014
that I'm an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

96
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,182
And this won't interfere
with you doing your job?

97
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:22,886
You mean my job as an amazing
Detective-slash-genius?

98
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,187
No, it will not.
I'll do all of my work,

99
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:25,389
guaranteed.

100
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,024
I'm considering it.

101
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,325
I'm interested.

102
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,827
I agree to participate.
All right.

103
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,397
There's the robot
I fell in love with.

104
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,731
<i>Hey.</i>

105
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,500
Sister Steve here got mugged.

106
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:37,901
Some guy dressed
as the royal baby

107
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:40,003
punched him
and took his wallet.

108
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,405
She keeps laughing at me.

109
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,839
Can't tell you how many nuns

110
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,174
I wanted to beat up
in catholic school.

111
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:45,575
Ten.

112
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,519
I didn't know you went
to catholic school.

113
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,179
Good. You shouldn't know it.

114
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,915
I get it.
You're so mysterious and tough.

115
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,400
But you know what I think?

116
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,085
You're actually a big softy.

117
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,611
No, I think she's really mean.

118
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,088
You probably read
a Maya angelou poem

119
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,948
at your graduation and cried.

120
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:01,625
Didn't graduate. Had to leave.

121
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:02,959
Why? What'd you do?

122
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,728
Here's a hint.

123
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:07,297
I'm not gonna tell you.

124
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:10,200
Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.

125
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:11,435
I'm a Detective.

126
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,904
I will detect!

127
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,305
Hey.

128
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,040
Got an arrest file here
for the Captain.

129
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,442
Drunk and disorderly.

130
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,277
So, anyways...

131
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,745
Gina!

132
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,213
We never talk anymore.

133
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,848
How's the dance troupe?
Did you get a haircut?

134
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,249
What's the Captain's
schedule like today?

135
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:28,185
I'm not gonna help you
rob him, Jake.

136
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,287
I'm his assistant,
and I take that job

137
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,980
incredibly seriously.

138
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,256
You're literally making
paper airplanes

139
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,991
out of police reports
right now.

140
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,660
Well, how am I supposed to get
it into that garbage can?

141
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,928
<i>Please, Gina?</i>

142
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:39,496
Fine, Captain's got a meeting

143
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,431
downstairs in ten minutes.

144
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:44,267
You're the best. Mwah!

145
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:45,635
What does your skin taste like?

146
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,771
Dina Lohan.
I'm wearing her face lotion.

147
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,606
That's it.

148
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,441
Thank you.

149
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,376
Okay, party's
around the corner.

150
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,779
Tipster said there'll be
a huge amount of drug activity.

151
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:58,181
Why is this costume so stiff?

152
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,150
And what is that smell?

153
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,952
The department never washes
them, so it's probably vomit.

154
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,186
Hey!

155
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:05,288
I got you a chocolate.

156
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,991
Yet another great thing
about Halloween... chocolate!

157
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,993
Thanks. Oh, look.

158
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,162
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka
right from the bottle.

159
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,864
<i>People think
if they put on a costume,</i>

160
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,366
<i>they can just get away
with anything they want.</i>

161
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,402
Halloween is Christmas
for jerks.

162
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:21,505
Come on, ma'am.
No open containers.

163
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,342
Oh, and why should I listen
to you, bone person?

164
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:28,011
It's called skelon.
It's a very common word.

165
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,513
Just put the vodka away.

166
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,781
<i>You guys are cops?</i>

167
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,282
These guys are cops!

168
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,360
Are you in my ceiling, Peralta?

169
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,128
<i>No.</i>

170
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,563
So what's the plan?

171
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:47,864
You wait for me
to leave my office,

172
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,232
lower yourself down,
take my medal,

173
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,467
and win the bet?

174
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,735
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

175
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>There's no one up here.</i>

176
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,138
Peralta, just so you know,

177
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,808
right now, I am taking
my medal off the wall

178
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,810
and placing it in a locked safe

179
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,653
whose combination is known
only to me.

180
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,613
The safe, in turn,

181
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,215
is locked in the cabinet.

182
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:09,653
The only key to that cabinet
is on my person.

183
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:12,022
I'm off to my meeting.
Good luck with your plan.

184
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,524
<i>You think that scares me?</i>

185
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,561
<i>I laugh in the face
of adversity!</i>

186
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:19,262
<i>Are you still there?</i>

187
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,697
<i>Captain, are you still there?
I can't hear...</i>

188
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:23,200
Agh!

189
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,994
<i>Ow.</i>

190
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,627
Here you go.

191
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,262
Don't touch the butter.

192
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,831
What happened?
I thought you guys

193
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:34,099
were supposed to be
at the warehouse party.

194
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,467
We got egged.

195
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:37,168
Some of the shell
got in my contacts

196
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,738
and my hair and my mouth
and my bra.

197
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:41,006
I can't tell
if that's hot or not.

198
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,273
Not hot.

199
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:43,508
Eggshell in my bra is not hot.

200
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:44,776
Well, it's kinda hot.

201
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:47,946
Boobs go in a bra. Up top.

202
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:50,115
Whoo! My man.

203
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:52,183
Well, it sounds like
costume duty is going great.

204
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,618
So great.
We're having the best time.

205
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,819
Right, Amy?

206
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,621
I wish I was dead. <i>Hmm.</i>

207
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,289
How's the unwinnable bet going?

208
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,624
Well, on the one hand,
I fell through the ceiling

209
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,459
and onto a pencil,
but on the other hand,

210
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,161
I also badly bruised my brain.

211
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,529
If you wanted to make
a bet with Holt,

212
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,864
you shoulda made a bet
you could win.

213
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,499
Like who wears
more denim jackets.

214
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,134
That was one time.

215
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,802
You guys never forget anything.

216
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,137
You know, frankly,
I'm a little surprised

217
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,605
you don't think
I can win this thing.

218
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,273
You're always telling me
how I'm the best.

219
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:17,375
You're the best, Jake.

220
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,105
Paperwork delivery.

221
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,412
You're the best, Jake.

222
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,380
Jake, you're the best.

223
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,149
Thank you, Charles.

224
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,684
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.

225
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,519
<i>Look, Jake,</i>

226
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:29,554
I love you like you're one of my daughters.
Really?

227
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,790
But it's not about you
or how smart you are.

228
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,024
It's about Captain Holt.

229
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,592
The man's a genius.

230
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,127
He's had your number
at every turn.

231
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:40,298
Well, not this day...
Turn... time.

232
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,468
Sorry, I'm pretty sure
I had a concussion back there.

233
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:44,769
Here I come. All right.

234
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:48,206
Ohh, strong. Ahh.

235
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,175
<i>Okay, here's the first set</i>

236
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,843
<i>of royal babies I rounded up.</i>

237
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,078
Popular costume.

238
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,345
Any of these guys
look familiar?

239
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:55,880
Maybe the third guy.

240
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,482
The baby who mugged me
was pretty short.

241
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,018
You're not supposed
to laugh at me.

242
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,519
<i>Number three,</i>

243
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,154
step forward and say,
"give me your money,

244
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:04,522
you stupid bag of crap."

245
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,358
Gimme your money,
you stupid bag of crap.

246
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,727
No, wrong giant baby.

247
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,028
I still want to know
why you got kicked out

248
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,596
of catholic school.

249
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,164
Were you doing drugs?

250
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,000
Worse. Selling drugs?

251
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,337
Worse.
How bad could it have been?

252
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:22,040
Did you burn down a church?

253
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,909
Number three, step forward
and say the word

254
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,211
"worse."

255
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,913
Worse.

256
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,715
Excuse me, Gina.

257
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,050
I can't find Peralta anywhere,
and you're the only one

258
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,721
who can decipher
his handwriting.

259
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,387
He arrested that bunny,
but I don't know what for.

260
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,390
He's either a crispy
mother werewolf

261
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,260
or cowboy mustard,
oslo, Norway.

262
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,728
Hmm.

263
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,898
The bunny groped multiple women
on the subway.

264
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,434
Being able to read
Jake's writing is a gift.

265
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,569
A useless, useless gift.

266
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,573
<i>Excuse me one second.</i>

267
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,709
Nice costume, Peralta.

268
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,544
No Peralta here.

269
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:03,114
Just a normal janitor
pushing trash around.

270
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,816
Come out of there.

271
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:08,319
Captain, hey.

272
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,554
You really thought
this was gonna work?

273
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:10,822
Uh, it did work.

274
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,090
This whole janitor gambit

275
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,892
was designed to fail.

276
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,160
It's just like in chess.

277
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,594
Sometimes in order to win,

278
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:18,096
you have to sacrifice
your king.

279
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,831
That's exactly how
you lose in chess.

280
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,132
Have you ever played the game?

281
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,567
Yeah, I used to play
with my uncle Bob

282
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,402
all the time,
and he said I was great.

283
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:26,604
This is a game
of concentration, Jake.

284
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,641
So focus your mind,
and start shooting.

285
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,814
Now you're a master
of chess, huh?

286
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,182
He taught me how to shoot
backgammon too.

287
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,583
I expected better of you.

288
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:39,851
You could have at least
created a diversion

289
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:41,820
to distract me
from your terrible costume.

290
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:43,454
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.

291
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:45,023
I had a diversion planned.

292
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,859
There was just
a slight timing issue.

293
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,327
Oh, my God!

294
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,496
Get down, everyone!
There's a big fire!

295
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:53,231
Captain, you better head
over there for, like,

296
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,600
15 minutes and see what's
going on with that.

297
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,603
Beware of the back draft.
I'll be in your office.

298
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,174
You have beautiful eyes.

299
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,442
<i>Have it your way.</i>

300
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:06,344
But you're gonna need this.

301
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,613
And... that.

302
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:11,349
It's filthy in there.

303
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,857
Come on, Amy! Loosen up!

304
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,158
You look like such a cop!

305
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:22,660
Come on, have some fun,
you know?

306
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,963
It'll help you blend in!

307
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,231
Whoo!

308
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,833
Stop trying to get me
to love Halloween.

309
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,468
It'll never work.

310
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,736
I'm backing it up.

311
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,505
Oh, God, please don't.

312
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,708
Hey, heads up.

313
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:37,976
I'll cut 'em off at the exit.
Okay.

314
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:41,045
Move! Move, move!

315
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,480
He ditched the drugs.
I'm on it.

316
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,915
Ugh.

317
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:47,552
Oof, everything
is sticking to me.

318
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:48,887
Ooh.

319
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,822
Ay, h. Yes.

320
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:52,824
<i>Hey, watch out, man.</i>

321
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,826
Ugh! What is that?

322
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:59,063
How is it hot <i>and</i> cold?

323
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:02,100
So the soonest you can fix
the ceiling is Monday?

324
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:11,376
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

325
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,844
Wait, stop scratching me.

326
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,048
We're supposed to be a team.

327
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,747
Ahem.

328
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,115
Captain, hi.

329
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,751
<i>I was just photocopying
some stuff.</i>

330
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,519
Are you trying to jam pigeons
into my air-conditioning vent

331
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,754
to flush me out of my office?

332
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,056
Way to ruin the surprise.

333
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,458
How did you get those birds?
<i>By using my big, fat brain.</i>

334
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,227
Get in the bag, you damn bird.

335
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,461
Eat the bread. Eat the bread!

336
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:32,063
I gotcha! I gotcha!

337
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:34,933
All part of my elaborate plan
to defeat you.

338
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,302
So far, you and
your big, fat brain

339
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,203
are losing... badly.

340
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,439
Maybe, if we're talking
about who's winning our bet.

341
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,875
But if we're talking
about who's holding more birds,

342
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,843
I'm winning, four-nothing.

343
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:48,913
You're only holding two.

344
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:52,283
Yeah.

345
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:56,217
Ooh, when you were
logging in the drugs,

346
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,619
you missed some awesome stuff.

347
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,721
Guy walked by in full
astronaut costume,

348
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:00,989
gave me a high five.

349
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,157
He high-fived me too.

350
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,459
Wait... Hitchcock?

351
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,960
Darn it.

352
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,228
I wasn't supposed to talk,
but I got so excited

353
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,496
about that astronaut.

354
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,131
What is happening?

355
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:11,466
Amy paid me 50 bucks
to trade places with her

356
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,734
for the rest of the night.

357
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,102
Really? Yeah.

358
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:17,138
I'm gonna use that money
to buy two suits.

359
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:21,509
Well, I was gonna ask you
to tell the Captain

360
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,011
that I brought in royal babies
for Diaz,

361
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,879
but I'm sure he already knows,

362
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,147
since he's always one step
ahead of me.

363
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:27,348
Aww.

364
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,050
<i>Why so down, little clown?</i>

365
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,318
<i>I'm just sick of losing
to Holt.</i>

366
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,519
<i>I want that medal.</i>

367
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,987
It's not real gold.

368
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:35,290
I tried selling it online.
Zero bids.

369
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:37,692
But here's some advice
I gave to the girls

370
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:40,046
in my dance troupe at the "dance
till you drop" tournament.

371
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:43,364
That advice was, dance. Dance!

372
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:45,033
<i>Dance.</i>

373
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,869
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that applies here, Gina.

374
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,938
It does apply.
It means don't give up.

375
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,607
We would've won if
Natasha's water hadn't broken.

376
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,542
Oh, Natasha had her baby?
You know Natasha?

377
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:55,777
Yeah. Yeah.

378
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:57,045
Her dog has lupus.

379
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,846
Yeah. That's a trip.

380
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,848
Small world. Yes.

381
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:05,720
All right, I'm gonna go cry.

382
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:07,522
I kind of feel bad for him.

383
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:08,723
<i>Don't.</i>

384
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:10,458
He brought this on himself.

385
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,762
You can hang up now.

386
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,698
You paid money to get
out of working with me?

387
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,766
Charles, I had to.
Tonight has been awful.

388
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,569
Halloween is the worst,
and I don't understand

389
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,937
why you like it.

390
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,405
No, all the things
that you think are bad

391
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,741
about Halloween
are what make it great.

392
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,242
The big kids egg you.

393
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:31,112
Then you and your friends
run away together.

394
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:33,081
Friendships are forged
in the crucible

395
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,483
of Halloween adversity.

396
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,353
That's all I wanted for us.

397
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:43,224
You can keep the wig.
I don't need it anymore.

398
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:46,327
I don't really need it either.

399
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,662
<i>Hey, Captain Holt,</i>

400
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:51,499
<i>can you come out here
for one sec?</i>

401
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,274
You need something, Peralta?
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

402
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,311
Hit it, royal babies.

403
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,313
What... no!

404
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,557
Give me my keys.

405
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:18,259
Will you stop catching me?

406
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,094
Do you have any idea how much
I spent on key chains?

407
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,629
$23.

408
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,031
Wow, that is
unbelievably close.

409
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,465
22.76.

410
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,101
Keys. Okay, look.

411
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:28,536
Tonight has been
a little humiliating.

412
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,004
Things are not going well,

413
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,606
so I'm gonna just
throw this out there.

414
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,041
What do you say
we call off the bet

415
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,442
and pretend this whole thing
never happened?

416
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:35,943
Oh, I'm not letting you
off the hook.

417
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,645
What? No. Pfft.

418
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,515
I meant to give you an out,
so you could save face.

419
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:42,483
This is getting sad.

420
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,259
Yeah, for you.

421
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,178
So.

422
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,123
I called your school.

423
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:53,961
And I managed to get a hold
of one sister Bernadette.

424
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,464
I remember that old bag.
She was my favorite.

425
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,799
Well, guess what she said.

426
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,967
Apparently, you were
a model student

427
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:03,037
and transferred
of your own volition.

428
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:06,641
Fine.

429
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,076
The reason I left
catholic school

430
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,278
was because I got into
the american ballet academy.

431
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,313
I was a classical dancer.

432
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:13,815
And I was good.

433
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,083
I knew it!

434
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:16,851
I knew you were a big softy.

435
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,754
You tell anyone,
I break your face.

436
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:26,259
No, you won't.
You're too sensitive.

437
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:29,964
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

438
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,233
<i>Some officers
just arrested Peralta.</i>

439
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,634
What? <i>They caught him scaling</i>

440
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,536
the side of the building
with a blowtorch.

441
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,509
Captain.

442
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,144
Welcome to the endgame.

443
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,679
Would you care to shake
the hand

444
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,280
of the man who defeated you?

445
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,550
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs.
Ohh, that hurt.

446
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,986
Whoo!

447
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,256
Climbing the side of
the building with a blowtorch.

448
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:57,591
What were you thinking?

449
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,193
I was thinking I had
better core strength.

450
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:00,427
I got winded, like,
ten feet up.

451
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,196
I knew you wouldn't
win the bet,

452
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,630
but your performance tonight
has made me question

453
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,098
not only how good
a Detective you are,

454
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:08,235
but, quite frankly,
how smart you are.

455
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,537
Well, that's not surprising.
You constantly underestimate me.

456
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:13,640
No, you've been
correctly estimated.

457
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,076
You have five minutes
until your deadline,

458
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,045
and here you are,
handcuffed to a table,

459
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,413
in a locked room.

460
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:23,417
Which is precisely
where I planned on being.

461
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,118
Captain, let me tell you
a little story.

462
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:26,954
You remember when
I fell through your ceiling?

463
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,856
Yes, that was six hours ago.

464
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,991
It was, I admit,
a disastrous failure.

465
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,327
But it gave me the idea
for Herman,

466
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,795
the friendly janitor you met.

467
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,798
With Herman, I commenced
the perfect crime.

468
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,033
I caught you as Herman.

469
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,469
But you didn't catch Rosa.

470
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,773
Come out of there.

471
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:48,008
<i>It turns out that Rosa</i>

472
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,043
<i>is great at picking locks.</i>

473
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,446
Does not surprise me.
No, me neither.

474
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,314
Of course, I had to find a way
to get her out of your office

475
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,682
without you seeing her.

476
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,618
<i>So I created a diversion.</i>

477
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:00,587
Not mistimed... Perfectly timed

478
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:02,122
so she could escape unseen.

479
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,423
What about the pigeons?

480
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,925
Oh, the gray pigeons?

481
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,727
<i>They were a red herring.
Thank you.</i>

482
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,762
<i>Their only purpose was
to draw you into the copy room</i>

483
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:12,933
<i>while two members of my team
broke into your locked office.</i>

484
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:13,967
<i>So now I had a way
into your office</i>

485
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,603
<i>and an open cabinet.</i>

486
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,438
All that was left was
for the royal babies

487
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,840
to steal your keys.

488
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,808
Yes, but you didn't need
the keys.

489
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,577
The cabinet
was already unlocked.

490
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,945
You needed a way into the safe.

491
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,480
And I got it.

492
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,948
<i>You were so concerned
with getting</i>

493
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,216
<i>your keys back,
you didn't even notice</i>

494
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,218
<i>the sergeant steal your phone.</i>

495
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,654
<i>That's right, even
the sergeant is on my side.</i>

496
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:35,822
<i>I then had Charles dust
your screen cover for prints.</i>

497
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,491
<i>The greasiest smudges revealed</i>

498
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,159
<i>the four numbers
you use the most...</i>

499
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:41,295
The four numbers
in your passcode.

500
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:42,996
Based on your advanced age,

501
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,299
I assumed that you use the same
passcode for everything...

502
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,467
Your phone, your email,
and, of course,

503
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:48,735
your safe.

504
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,278
That would be
a fair assumption.

505
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,873
It was at that point
that I bumped into a girl

506
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,876
dressed as a sexy robot,
and we got our flirt on... hard.

507
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,980
'Sup?

508
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:04,184
'Sup? Jake Peralta.

509
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,852
And how was flirting
part of the plan?

510
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,021
Oh, it wasn't. It just ruled.

511
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,589
And that brings us
to five minutes ago,

512
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,891
when Amy came to your office
and told you

513
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,326
that I had been arrested.

514
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,694
I knew she's the only one
you would believe

515
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,329
because, frankly,
she's usually too lame

516
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,138
to take part
in these kinds of things.

517
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,099
And as you walked over here,

518
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,667
Charles awkwardly stuffed
himself through your window

519
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,170
and opened your safe.

520
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,172
We had the four numbers
of your code, which meant

521
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,374
there were 24 possible
combinations for Charles to try.

522
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,042
That could take
up to four minutes,

523
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,860
which is why I really dragged
out this explanation.

524
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,113
I mean, really stretched it.
I don't know if you noticed,

525
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,681
but there were times
where I was like,

526
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,616
what am I even talking about?
This isn't...

527
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,151
Oh.

528
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:40,921
But now, four minutes is up.

529
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:43,090
Which means Boyle is either
on the other side of that door

530
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,324
holding your medal,

531
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,427
or I've lost.

532
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:48,862
Well, Captain,

533
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,364
<i>it seems that Jake</i>

534
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:54,434
isn't the only person
you underestima...

535
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:58,038
20 seconds to spare.
Game over, Captain.

536
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,239
Check me.

537
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,774
I think you mean "checkmate."

538
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,275
You really need to learn
how to play chess.

539
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:04,745
<i>How did you get everyone
to help you?</i>

540
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,546
I appealed to their sense
of teamwork and camraderie

541
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,049
with a rousing speech that would
put Shakespeare to shame.

542
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,317
For too long,

543
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,153
we've been put down, ridiculed,

544
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,055
made to wear ties!

545
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,289
But no more!

546
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,591
<i>For today,</i>

547
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,593
we defeat him!

548
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:22,203
And that worked?
No. No, no. Not at all.

549
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,297
My speech did not inspire them.

550
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,366
Come on. So I bribed them.

551
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,201
I told them that if we
pulled this off,

552
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,803
I would do
all of their paperwork.

553
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,072
And since you're doing
all my paperwork...

554
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,907
I'm impressed, Peralta.

555
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,242
Well done.

556
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,777
Thank you, sir.

557
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:40,080
In fact, the thing
that you failed to see, Captain,

558
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,115
<i>teamwork, is exactly...</i>
Captain?

559
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,117
<i>What provided our success.</i> Sir?

560
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:47,087
He's not coming back.

561
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:50,123
<i>Boyle, I need you
in the briefing room.</i>

562
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,264
<i>What is all this?</i>

563
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,932
You know how I think
Halloween is for jerks?

564
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:01,601
Well, this Halloween,
I was the jerk.

565
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,336
I'm sorry about tonight.

566
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:04,671
"I'm sorry about tonight."

567
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,139
We found the title

568
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,208
for Santiago's
follow-up sex tape.

569
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,811
I'm sorry I couldn't convince
you to love Halloween.

570
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:12,212
It's not your fault.
I was terrible.

571
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,480
"It's not your fault
I was terrible"

572
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,015
is also one of your sex tapes.

573
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,316
Ow.

574
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,652
Halloween is unbearable.

575
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,655
But it was slightly less
unbearable with you.

576
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:22,989
Don't. Okay.

577
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,591
Anyway.

578
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,160
We're all going to the bar,
so get changed,

579
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,962
'cause you can't be
the only one there

580
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,897
not wearing a 'stume.

581
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,133
'Stume! Oh, my God.
It caught on.

582
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,803
No.

583
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:39,673
Ah, Captain Holt.
It is so nice to see you.

584
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,174
Never thought I'd say that.
Hmm.

585
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,310
A poor winner.
I never would've guessed.

586
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:44,878
Yeah, you would've.

587
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,346
Way to go all out
on your costume, by the way.

588
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:48,448
I believe you have
an announcement to make,

589
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,817
so the floor is yours.

590
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,820
Attention, everyone.

591
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:58,325
Jake Peralta is an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

592
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,393
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

593
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,530
I have some paperwork to do.

594
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,932
All right.

595
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,401
Officer in the 92nd got
the royal baby mugger.

596
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,936
He had 19 wallets
in his diaper.

597
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,373
<i>We got a runner!</i>

598
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:15,242
Waahhh!

599
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,544
Damn!

600
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,346
Oh, I didn't tell you.

601
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,748
I got kicked out
of ballet school

602
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:25,084
for beating the crap
out of ballerinas.

603
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,549
It's a good thing we gave 'em a heads up.

604
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,719
Team effort, Go 99.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

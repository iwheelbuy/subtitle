1
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:02,973
He's here.
Boyle is here.

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,223
This is so fun!

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:06,626
I wish you guys
got shot more often.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,480
Buh-buh-buh-back
in the nine nine.

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,005
Welcome back, Detective.

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,160
Wow, is this all for me?

7
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,121
<i>Of course it is.</i>

8
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:16,115
What're you wearing,
there, buddy?

9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,615
Oh, none of my pants
fit over my butt cast.

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,859
Lucky for me my
lent me her leg warmers.

11
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:22,333
That is lucky.

12
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:23,968
Pretty sweet scooter.

13
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,699
Yeah, I know.
Check out these doughnuts.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,103
Whoo-hoo!

15
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,187
Oh, that went terribly.
Can I help you with something?

16
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,270
Nope, nope.
Everything's under control.

17
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,904
I picked up a couple
reacher grabbers.

18
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,091
Yeah.

19
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:36,950
So I'm able to do
everything that I used to do.

20
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,777
So now, if you'll excuse me,

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,733
I'm going to go make myself
a morning cup of coffee

22
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,559
like I do every day.

23
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:45,091
Okay, okay.

24
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,662
<i>Just gotta...
No problem.</i>

25
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,380
Oh...
The heart is the hardest part.

26
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,817
Let me get that
for you, Boyle.

27
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:54,291
No need. No need at all.

28
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,669
That's sweet, Rosa.
Here we go.

29
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,791
<i>Ah...</i>

30
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,586
Hey, Charles, just take
my coffee. It's fresh.

31
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,246
Okay, I guess.
I mean, if you don't mind.

32
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:03,138
All right, you got it? Ah...

33
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:04,452
No problem.

34
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,638
Why wouldn't you
just use your other hand?

35
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:09,115
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Hot coffee in my cast!

36
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:10,092
Ah!

37
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:12,498
Ah...

38
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,555
Cold milk.

39
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,158
Cold milk.

40
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,344
That's coming out
the bottom.

41
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:17,402
It is coming out the bottom
of my cast.

42
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:18,588
<i> All right.</i>

Hey.

45
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:42,500
What's going on?

46
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,456
Just picked him up on a dozen
counts of identity theft.

47
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:45,962
His name is Doug Judy.

48
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,366
You ever seen him before?
No.

53
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:56,989
I think he's into me.

54
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,207
What do you do
to these perps?

55
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,739
Fear is a powerful
aphrodisiac.

56
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,367
Anyway, he said he wants
to speak to "John

57
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,771
or Jack Peralta
or whatever."

58
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:06,861
What does he want
with me?

59
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,945
And should I change my name
to Jack Peralta?

60
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,387
That sounds badass.

61
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,887
Jack Peralta, crocodile hunter.

62
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,169
Yeah.

63
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,420
He said he wants a deal.

64
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,599
He has some information about
some dude who steals Pontiacs.

65
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:20,388
Pontiacs? He knows about
the Pontiac bandit.

66
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,214
Listen to me,
he specifically said

67
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,369
he knows a guy
who steals Pontiacs?

68
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,715
Yeah, I just said that.
Chill, man.

69
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:26,510
Okay.

70
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,690
Okay, sorry.

71
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,734
M'kay.

72
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,049
<i>Hey, Diaz.</i>

73
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,492
Come here
and talk to me.

74
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:36,158
This dude is super horny.

75
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,504
Yeah.

76
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:42,120
Ah. Whoa.

77
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,319
<i>Backing up, guys.</i>

78
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,243
Oh, are you? Huh.

79
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,846
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,384
One of these buttons...

81
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,987
Sorry, sorry.

82
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,494
Oh, you don't have to apologize
for anything, Boyle.

83
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,000
You were shot
in the line of duty,

84
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,667
defending a fellow
officer.

85
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:05,199
You know, the doctor said
that if the bullet

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,834
was two millimeters
to the left

87
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:09,270
and a foot higher, I might
never have walked again.

88
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,033
Everyone here appreciates
your heroism, Boyle.

89
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,731
We all want your
first day back

90
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,200
to be as pleasant and
as comfortable as possible.

91
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:16,354
Right, detectives?

92
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,733
Absolutely.

93
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:20,489
Hey, Boyle. You want to choose
where we order lunch from today?

94
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,374
Really? You're lifting
the lifetime ban?

95
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,393
I thought my
lunch choices were

96
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:27,765
"horrifying
adventures in diarrhea."

97
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,047
Today, Charles, we take
that adventure with you.

98
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:30,489
<i>All right!</i>

99
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,964
I've been craving
Sudanese all day.

100
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,112
<i>I'll print out some menus.</i>

101
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,515
Ouch.

102
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,471
You ran over my foot.

103
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:41,773
I am in incredible pain.

104
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,599
I used to work
at a chop shop.

105
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,869
It was chill.
Decent hours, good benefits.

106
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,081
You could work
while you were High.

107
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:51,036
Which I never did,
'cause that's irresponsible.

108
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,895
Anyway, we did a lot
of work for this dude

109
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,594
who stole Pontiacs.

110
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:55,908
The Pontiac bandit!

111
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,690
Okay. We called him bill,
but whatever.

112
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,126
No, not whatever. The Pontiac
bandit is my Nemesis.

113
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,761
I've been chasing
this guy for eight years.

114
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,845
He's stolen hundreds of cars,
all of them Pontiacs.

115
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,159
<i>He's never left
any evidence,</i>

116
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,538
and he's never
been caught on Cam

117
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,499
the guy is a ghost.

118
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,461
Super ghost.

119
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:11,423
He's a super ghost!

120
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,576
Before we go any further,

121
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:13,730
we need to know
if you're for real.

122
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:14,756
Describe the guy.

123
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:15,717
<i>Asian dude.</i>

124
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,545
Maybe 5'8",
spiky black hair.

125
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:20,750
Rocks in both ears.
Always wears a black suit.

126
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,289
And speaks with
a British accent.

127
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,847
Like my girl Dame Judi Dench.
I have impeccable taste.

128
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,898
So would you say
he looks sort of like...

129
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:28,860
This?

130
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,270
That's bill.

131
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,744
This is a composite sketch
from ten interviews I've done.

132
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:32,866
Perfect match.

133
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,783
So all you know is what
a bunch of other mopes

134
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:36,745
have said over the years.

135
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,155
Anything else?

136
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:41,233
Yeah. I know how to get
in touch with him.

137
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,470
Doug Judy!

138
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,201
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

139
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,893
My husband's dog cheddar had
relations with our neighbor dog

140
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,362
karate and produced
these two smaller dogs

141
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:54,952
he insisted that I find them a
good home with someone we trust.

142
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,061
You can trust me.

143
00:04:58,062 --> 00:04:59,888
Dogs are my whole life.

144
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,202
Also work.

145
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,317
Doing work
and hanging with dogs.

146
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:05,497
That's my lifestyle.

147
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:10,369
You're allergic to dogs,
aren't you? Nope.

148
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:12,324
I just need an epipen
because my happiness

149
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,959
is making my throat close up.

150
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,229
Hand me the small dog,
Santiago.

151
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:23,896
So the burner phone
that Doug Judy used

152
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,980
to contact the Pontiac bandit
is at his mom's house.

153
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,679
He's agreed to help us
catch the bandit

154
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,986
if we drop all charges
against him.

155
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,166
How many cars would you say
this Pontiac bandit has stolen?

156
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,833
230 that I know of.

157
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,692
But the real number could be
in the millions.

158
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,616
You're not very good
at math.

159
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,250
What are the charges
against Judy?

160
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,436
12 counts of identity theft,

161
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:41,942
but I've been chasing him
for a month.

162
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,449
Oh, a month?

163
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,501
I've been trying to catch the
Pontiac bandit for eight years.

164
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,494
You know how many
months that is?

165
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:47,456
96.

166
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,443
80... 40... and 6
years, months.

167
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,949
Do you need a math tutor?

168
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,360
Because the department
will provide one for you.

169
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,674
I can't tell if
you're being serious.

170
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:55,149
I'm on the fence here.

171
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,649
Diaz caught him.

172
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,803
It's your call.

173
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,815
Look, this guy is for real.
1,000 push-ups.

174
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,579
1,000 push-ups, really?
Yes.

175
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,335
Okay. I'm in.

176
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,194
<i>What's 1,000 push-ups?</i>

177
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:09,477
Oh, we were in
the academy together,

178
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:10,855
and we hated
all the drills, so now

179
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,778
when we're on a case and
one of us says 1,000 push-ups,

180
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,606
it means I'm so sure I'm right

181
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,144
that if I'm wrong,
I'll do 1,000 push-ups.

182
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,458
<i>It's a pact we made.</i>

183
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,541
It really just means
"trust me." And I do.

184
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:20,920
<i>Okay.</i>

185
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,683
Make the deal.
Yes!

186
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,889
I've got you now,
Pontiac bandit. Whoo!

187
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,779
Feels good to finally say that
in front of actual people

188
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,838
instead of just the mirror.

189
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,577
All right, so we grab
the burner, catch the bandit,

190
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:34,404
become police legends.

191
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,320
My mom's car is here.
She's home.

192
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,315
Can I take these cuffs off?

193
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,276
No way.

194
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:40,590
She doesn't know
I'm a criminal.

195
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,219
She thinks I own an architecture
firm with all white employees.

196
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,661
That's racist.

197
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,264
Why stop there? Why not tell her
you're an astronaut?

198
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,995
'Cause space is scary.

199
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:49,277
You saw what it did
to Sandy bullock.

200
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,687
Yeah, I'm with him
on this one.

201
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,034
I'll stay on earth,
thank you very much.

202
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,957
Yeah.

203
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,303
Come on, Rosa.

204
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:57,098
We can play-act with his mom
for two minutes to get a lead.

205
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,085
Fine.

206
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,643
One false move, and I tase you
in front of your mom.

207
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:07,547
Dougie!
Oh, my beautiful boy.

208
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:10,240
Well, shouldn't you be
at work?

209
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,516
Never too busy to see my mama. Oh.

210
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:16,715
Mama, this is
my girlfriend Rosa.

211
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,888
And this is my
personal assistant.

212
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,652
Mangy Carl.

213
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,120
Aw, it's nice to meet you.
You can just call me Carl.

214
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,139
Mangy Carl used to be
a homeless gentleman.

215
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,677
I work with a charity
that finds jobs

216
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,504
for down-on-their-luck
white people.

217
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,755
Oh...

218
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:34,473
He's just a big, old angel.
He's been so good to...

219
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:35,691
The whites.

220
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,095
Yes, he is.

221
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,633
Yeah.
This guy.

222
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:40,594
Aw...

223
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:43,705
Hey, speaking of which, we
should probably grab that phone,

224
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,813
you know, so you can
get back to architecturals.

225
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:48,320
Yes, it's in
the spare bedroom.

226
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,756
I'll go with you.
It's a mess.

227
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,230
Actually, we can handle it
on our own, ma'am.

228
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:53,225
Thank you so much.

229
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,949
Why don't you just
stay up here and...

230
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,577
Chop it up with Rosa?

231
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,116
Well, that sounds nice.

232
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,490
We can get to know
each other a little.

233
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,155
I love getting
to know people.

234
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,405
It's my jam.

235
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,315
Oh, how good is this food?

236
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:10,917
I'm eating it.

237
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,744
They accidentally
put a stone in mine.

238
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,700
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that's the hoof!

239
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,617
That's the best
part of the stew!

240
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:18,931
Oh, man.

241
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:22,104
Think of it as marrow nugget
wrapped in a thick toenail.

242
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,669
<i>Mmm.</i>

243
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,175
Hey, did I tell you guys
what the doctor said?

244
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:27,137
Mm-hmm.

245
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,579
Couple times.

246
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,791
But we'd love
to hear it again.

247
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,163
He said that if the bullet was a
fraction of an inch to the left

248
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:36,048
and two feet up,
it woulda hit my brain.

249
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,586
Oh...
Yeah.

250
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,016
Oh...

251
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:45,376
"Back in the game.
When can we meet?"

252
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:48,420
Damn, you're a good assistant.
I could get used to this.

253
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,575
How long till he usually
gets back to you?

254
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,851
Like ten minutes.
Chill, mangy.

255
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,581
I can't chill. I've never
been this close before.

256
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,563
I gotta admit, your enthusiasm
makes me want you to catch him.

257
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,325
Thank you.

258
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,767
Are these laserdiscs?

259
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,146
Yeah, I robbed
a tower records back in '92.

260
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:02,620
Kept my faves.

261
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,544
Doug Judy.
Ooh.

262
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,723
<i>Blade runner, tron,</i> oh!

263
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,909
<i>Fievel goes west?</i>

264
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,185
Yes, sir.
Love that little mouse.

265
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,141
His journey...
The story of America.

266
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,615
I could not agree more.

267
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:15,602
Fievel?
Papa.

268
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,397
Fievel!
Papa!

269
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,673
Fie-vel!
Pa-pa!

270
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:20,635
Fie-vel!

271
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:21,596
You guys having fun?

272
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:22,782
Hey.
'Cause I'm not.

273
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,122
His mom put this stupid
braid in my hair.

274
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:26,084
Oh, looks beautiful.

275
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,808
Yeah, it's kinda cute.

276
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,572
Please have my children.

277
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,129
It's him.

278
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,469
Parking lot on Flatbush
and Vanderbilt in 15 minutes.

279
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,778
Let's go. <i> Wait, wait, wait.</i>

280
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,386
Diaz looks like
a dirty criminal.

281
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:40,412
But you look like a cop, man.

282
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,373
You can't go over there
like that.

283
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,450
What'd you have in mind?

284
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,150
♪ Don't call it a comeback

291

I don't look

292
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,106
No, you look like
a Boyz II Men Easter album.

293
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,324
Burn.

294
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:06,215
That's not a burn,
that's cool.

295
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:09,421
Gina, we've been
looking all over for you.

296
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:10,831
You can't just disappear

297
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:13,203
and leave a sign on your desk
that says, "gone leavin'."

298
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,293
<i>I'm hiding from Charles.</i>

299
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:16,216
I can't take him anymore.

300
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,754
<i>It's safe in here</i>

301
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:20,543
'cause his scooter can't get up
the steps in the hallway.

302
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:21,729
Gina, have some compassion.

303
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,557
Boyle got hurt
doing something brave.

304
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:26,248
You didn't have to do
physical therapy with him, Amy.

305
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:28,749
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

306
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,602
Pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

307
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:33,910
All this cycling makes me
feel like Lance Armstrong.

308
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,865
Like you use
performance-enhancing drugs

309
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,243
and have one teste?

310
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:38,814
Wouldn't you like to know?

311
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,058
How long can you
possibly hide in here?

312
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,725
I sent all the Captain's
calls here,

313
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,840
my phone battery's
at 100% charge,

314
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,892
and I have ten loose
diner mints in my purse.

315
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:49,360
This is my home now.

316
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:52,629
I gotta say,
the suit is growing on me.

317
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,590
Looks good.

318
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:55,460
Is it triple-breasted
somehow?

319
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:56,475
There's no such thing.

320
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:58,142
What about the girl
in <i>total recall?</i>

321
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,355
Mmm. Triple bitties.

322
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:02,085
Triple bitties.
Triple bitties. Yeah.

323
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,046
Rosa...

324
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,098
There's no sign of anyone.

325
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,060
<i>You sure about this?</i>

326
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,053
1,000 push-ups.

327
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:09,266
Okay.

328
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,957
Heads up.

329
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:15,227
Who the hell are you?
Where's bill?

330
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:16,509
He hadn't heard
from you in a while,

331
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,369
so he sent me to make sure
everything was cool.

332
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,426
Apparently it's not.

333
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,741
Who are they?

334
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:21,894
They're with me.

335
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:24,491
This is the buyer. Carl Mangerman.
'Sup?

336
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:26,478
I don't know them,
I don't trust them.

337
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,851
He meets with you alone
or it's off.

338
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,517
I'll text the address.

339
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,588
Come on!

340
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,902
I promise you this.

341
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,428
They have not heard the last
of Carl mangerman.

342
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,595
Sergeant, I'd like you
to meet Richard and Dan.

343
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,556
They are puppies.

344
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,352
Very cute, sir.

345
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:48,884
Maybe your twins would like
some little, furry friends.

346
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:51,512
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's impossible.

347
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:52,794
With the twins
learning how to walk,

348
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,750
chaos reigns
at the Jeffords household.

349
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,987
I can't let those innocent
pups into that madhouse.

350
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,525
Terry won't do you like that.

351
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:00,519
<i>I understand.</i>

352
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,141
Just know you have
disappointed...

353
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:06,738
All three of us.

354
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,680
That's cold, sir.

355
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,892
All right,
it's worth the risk.

356
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,591
We send him in alone.

357
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,707
No, we do not. Something
doesn't smell right to me.

358
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,661
Could be my dad's suit.
He died in it.

359
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,655
He died in it?

360
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:23,342
Oh, man.

361
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,329
They just sent the location.

362
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,124
<i>Man, this dude is cautious.</i>

363
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,791
If I show up one minute late
or I'm not alone,

364
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,265
he's done with me.

365
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,675
This is your last shot.

366
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,438
I can't let the Pontiac bandit
get away.

367
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,778
Put a wire on him, get
a tactical team in as backup.

368
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,093
It's the only way.

369
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:38,567
Doug Judy and I know this guy.
You have to trust us.

370
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:39,529
Do I?

371
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,619
One of you is a criminal,

372
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,965
and the other one
is dressed like Steve Harvey.

373
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,003
It's over.
I'm ending this now.

374
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:44,978
Sorry, Jake.

375
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,741
Seriously?

376
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah. 1,000 push-ups.

377
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,427
Well, I raise you.
2,000 push-ups.

378
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,286
What?
That's not how this works.

379
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,889
I said 1,000 push-ups,
you have to back me up.

380
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,139
That's the pact,
end of story.

381
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,517
Well, I break the pact.

382
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:59,210
I hope you understand
how serious this is to me.

383
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,300
Come on, Rosa.

384
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,704
Can't you read
between the lines, man?

385
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:03,922
Don't quote <i>die hard.</i>

386
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,204
Sorry.

387
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,711
But we're still
sending him in alone.

388
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,177
<i>We need evidence,
so get him talking.</i>

389
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:13,222
Ask questions about money,
cars, specifics.

390
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,915
I'm getting kind of nervous,
man. This dude is for real.

391
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,004
You sure you got
everything covered?

392
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,093
Yeah.

393
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,761
<i>There's a body
on the back door,</i>

394
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:21,267
<i>eyes on the side door,</i>

395
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,191
<i>and two guys out on the corner.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

396
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,217
What about choppers?

397
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,428
You got choppers?
With snipers and rockets?

398
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:28,191
No one has
rocket choppers.

399
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:31,910
Although that does
sound amazing.

400
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,448
So, what'd I miss?

401
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,205
Tell me all the jokes.
Everything funny that happened.

402
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,512
Charles, we really
need to get back to...

403
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,339
Hitchcock called himself
Scully by accident.

404
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,577
I did. But it brought
me and Scully closer together.

405
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:44,859
<i>That's great!</i>

406
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:45,852
What else?

407
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,039
Oh...

408
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,955
Oh, I laughed too hard.
Lost another highlighter.

409
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:51,590
Does anyone have
skinny forearms?

410
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,712
Fine.

411
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:55,596
Great.

412
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,636
Yeah, it's way
down there by my butt.

413
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:00,598
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

414
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,879
Is that it?
Yup.

415
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,809
Oh, okay. <i> Right there.</i>

416
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,123
Ah!

417
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:05,726
Got it.

418
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,322
Oh, my God.
Where's my grandmother's ring?

419
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:10,342
Oop. Found it.

420
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,265
I'll be right back.

421
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,221
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

422
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:15,717
Please get out of my way.

423
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,157
Welcome to
the Boyle-free zone.

424
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:21,560
<i>Please turn off
all cell phones</i>

425
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,734
so as not to attract
any unwanted attention.

426
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,336
Can I offer you a mint?

427
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:29,094
<i>We got eyes on the bandit.
He's a block away.</i>

428
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,696
You ready?

429
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,491
You and me, Jakey.
We were born ready.

430
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,869
Go, Judy, go.

431
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,665
<i>We meet at last,
Pontiac bandit.</i>

432
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:43,677
For eight years
I've tracked you.

433
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,787
And today I'm taking you down.

434
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:47,826
Doug Judy, can you hear me?

435
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,415
Say something
to test the wire.

436
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,441
<i>Hey, Diaz...</i>

437
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,364
After we put the cuffs
on this guy,

438
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:53,967
I'll be free for dinner.

439
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,410
You like spaghetti?

440
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,782
And weed?

441
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,384
The mic works.

442
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:00,986
My man. What's up?

443
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,269
<i>Pleasure to see you again.</i>

444
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,583
<i>Let's talk about cars.</i>

445
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:05,154
<i>I got my shop
up and running again.</i>

446
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,077
<i>I can do anything you want.</i>

447
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,314
<i>Blue cars, red cars,
big cars, small cars,</i>

448
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,719
<i>you know, cars. Cars are
really great, aren't they?</i>

449
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,679
What is he doing?

450
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:16,918
Talking about cars.

451
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,431
Boyle, where is everyone?

452
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:23,713
Hiding from me
in the evidence room.

453
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,059
They think I don't know,

454
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,501
but Gina's been live
tweeting the whole thing.

455
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,425
She live tweets
everything.

456
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,515
Ruined <i>Downton Abbey</i> for me.

457
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:31,566
Maybe it was too soon
for me to come back.

458
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,041
I would've just
stayed at home,

459
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,323
but I was getting
lonely and bored.

460
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,631
One day I looked
out the window for four hours.

461
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,939
I didn't see anything.

462
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,413
Huh.

463
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,016
<i>You know what
else is great about cars?</i>

464
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,740
<i>The way they look.
How they stop, how they start.</i>

465
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,151
That's it. I'm calling it.

466
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,144
No!

467
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,426
Move, people,
we're going in now.

468
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:56,889
On your knees!
Hands on your head!

469
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,556
Gotcha, Pontiac bandit.

470
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,901
Where's Doug Judy?

471
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:02,338
He went to the bathroom.

472
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,332
I'm just here
to give him a haircut.

473
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,294
I don't know
what's going on.

474
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:05,608
A likely story, Pontiac...

475
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,755
But actually you do have
a lot of hair products.

476
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,845
He's gone. He ran.

477
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,159
Why would he do that?

478
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,179
He helped us catch the Pontiac
bandit. That was the deal.

479
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,589
Doesn't make
any sense unless...

480
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,160
Doug Judy is
the Pontiac bandit.

481
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,627
Put out an APB.

482
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,551
Seal off everything
for a 20-block radius.

483
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,121
<i>Yeah,
don't bother looking for me.</i>

484
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:22,852
I'm in the wind.

485
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,294
<i>If you're close
enough for me to hear you,</i>

486
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:25,929
you're close enough
for me to catch you.

487
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,885
Nah, I got a relay
set up, brother.

488
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:30,834
So if you're the Pontiac bandit,
who's this joker?

489
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,757
<i>Couple of years ago
you were getting really close,</i>

490
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,360
so I started telling
all my associates

491
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,956
if they ever get caught,
they should describe me as...

492
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,456
Asian dude, 5'8",
spiky hair.

493
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,675
Wears diamond earrings
and has a...

494
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,053
British accent.

495
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,848
So then you hired a guy who
matched that exact description.

496
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,130
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

497
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:47,823
That's my barber Norman Lee.
He gave me the idea.

498
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,746
You know, if you can't come in,
I do house calls.

499
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:50,996
You just text me a location

500
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,207
and I could be there
in half an hour.

501
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,746
Good to know.

502
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,605
You know, you should actually
use him while he's there.

503
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,111
He'll give you a dope fade.

504
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,644
I get dope enough fades from
my current barber, thank you.

505
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,150
So you dragged us over here,
went in there,

506
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:03,144
pretended to talk, and then
snuck out the basement.

507
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,555
Am I right?

508
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,830
<i>The basement connected
to another basement!</i>

509
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,657
Which connected to a garage,

510
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:09,972
which is where
my boy picked me up.

511
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,247
Your boy?

512
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,241
Oh, that guy from the meet-up.

513
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:14,651
<i>He works for you.</i>

514
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,254
He pretended to be spooked
by me and Diaz

515
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,761
in the parking lot
to make sure that

516
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,267
we let you go to
the next meeting by yourself.

517
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:20,966
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

518
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,281
You win a Teddy bear!

519
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,979
You lied to me, Doug Judy.

520
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,544
Gotta be honest, I'm pretty
disappointed right now.

521
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,050
I mean, was that even
really your mom?

522
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,332
<i>Hell yeah, that's my real mom.</i>

523
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:32,506
I wanted to see her one last
time before I disappeared.

524
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:34,237
I told you I was sensitive,
Rosa.

525
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,518
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>

526
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:37,538
Why don't you come back here
and take me out to dinner?

527
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,494
Ah...

528
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,000
I know you're
trying to trap me.

529
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,500
But crazy thing is
I'm tempted!

530
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,782
That's how hot I find you.

531
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,897
<i>Sorry it had to go down
this way, Peralta.</i>

532
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,949
<i>Maybe we could've been
friends in another world.</i>

533
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,103
<i>If I hadn't just fooled you</i>

534
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,513
like a little bitch!

535
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:55,937
Bitch!

536
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:57,582
'Kay.

537
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:03,466
Hey, Captain,
we thought we'd

538
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,780
get more work done
in here, because...

539
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,382
You're all hiding
from Boyle.

540
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:07,440
<i>Not me, Captain.</i>

541
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,433
I was napping.

542
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:09,780
That's worse.

543
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,126
<i>Captain,
we all think Boyle's a hero,</i>

544
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,850
but it's very difficult
to be around him right now.

545
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,454
<i>I was in
the bathroom with him, sir.</i>

546
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:17,088
It was a nightmare.

547
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,210
Hey, sarge,

548
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,909
this cast has a special
crotch hole.

549
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,089
It's like a doggy door
for my penis.

550
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,300
Shake.

551
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,602
That man took a bullet
for this precinct.

552
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,423
He's a guy who's always
looking for love and friendship.

553
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:32,571
And he needs it now
more than ever.

554
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,365
But you all turned
your backs on him.

555
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,314
And you should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

556
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,578
I'm sorry.
Those puppies are so cute.

557
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,789
They do undercut
your Tone a bit, sir.

558
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,936
<i>But on the plus side,</i>

559
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,277
I think I know
what to do with them.

560
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:51,001
<i>Detective Boyle.</i>

561
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:55,360
I think you might be able to
give these dogs a good home.

562
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:56,995
Ah...

563
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,149
You are off the scooter.

564
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,041
If you have fallen,
please call a doctor.

565
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,547
Oh, Captain...

566
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:02,893
I don't know
if I should... okay.

567
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,271
Oh...

568
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:07,189
That tickles.

569
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,586
They like me so much!

570
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:12,959
Are you crying, Santiago?

571
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,010
I'm so allergic.

572
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:17,158
Can you tell the scooter
to call an ambulance?

573
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,139
Hey.

574
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,388
So...

575
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,023
I went back to
the mom's house.

576
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:25,043
Unsurprisingly a dead end.

577
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:26,837
I got a lot of work
to do, Peralta.

578
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:27,799
<i>Wait.</i>

579
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,050
<i>I want to say something.</i>

580
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,523
We've worked together
long enough that I know

581
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,934
how much you hate apologies.

582
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:34,434
I just want to ask you
to join the Doug Judy case.

583
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,197
Officially, as partners.

584
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:39,595
I want to catch this guy,
and I can't do it without you.

585
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,223
No, you can't.

586
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,922
Now I bee I owe you
1,000 push-ups.

587
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:45,525
I don't care about
the push-ups, Jake.

588
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:46,935
I care that you
didn't honor our pact.

589
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,314
I've always trusted you,

590
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:49,596
and when you did that it made me
feel like you don't trust me.

591
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,455
I know, and I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

592
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,544
No, it won't.

593
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,275
Now get down on the floor.

594
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,071
What? You just said you didn't
care about the push-ups.

595
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,865
I changed my mind.

596
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,628
Fair enough.

597
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,930
A pact's a pact.

598
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:08,347
One, two, three...

599
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,143
612...

600
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,361
Night, Peralta.

601
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:14,951
Night.

602
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,932
613...

603
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,342
Hey, Ronald.

604
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,592
1,000...

605
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,605
Is so many push-ups.
I'm never gonna make it.

606
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,920
What am I at?

607
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,138
901.

608
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,901
Thank you, Captain.

609
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,215
You said 2,000, remember?

610
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,176
<i>Agh!</i>

611
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,613
I shoulda trusted you!

612
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:41,365

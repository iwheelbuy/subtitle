1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,679
He's here.
Boyle is here.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,980
This is so fun!

3
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:06,482
I wish you guys
got shot more often.

4
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:09,452
Buh-buh-buh-back
in the nine nine.

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,122
Welcome back, Detective.

6
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:14,324
Wow, is this all for me?

7
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:15,324
<i>Of course it is.</i>

8
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:16,359
What're you wearing,
there, buddy?

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,962
Oh, none of my pants
fit over my butt cast.

10
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:21,297
Lucky for me my
lent me her leg warmers.

11
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,832
That is lucky.

12
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,534
Pretty sweet scooter.

13
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:26,336
Yeah, I know.
Check out these doughnuts.

14
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,838
Whoo-hoo!

15
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:31,007
Oh, that went terribly.
Can I help you with something?

16
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,176
Nope, nope.
Everything's under control.

17
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:34,877
I picked up a couple
reacher grabbers.

18
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:36,112
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,047
So I'm able to do
everything that I used to do.

20
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:39,949
So now, if you'll excuse me,

21
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,985
I'm going to go make myself
a morning cup of coffee

22
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:43,886
like I do every day.

23
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,522
Okay, okay.

24
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:48,157
<i>Just gotta...
No problem.</i>

25
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,028
Oh...
The heart is the hardest part.

26
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,564
Let me get that
for you, Boyle.

27
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:56,099
No need. No need at all.

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,533
That's sweet, Rosa.
Here we go.

29
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:58,701
<i>Ah...</i>

30
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:00,570
Hey, Charles, just take
my coffee. It's fresh.

31
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:03,339
Okay, I guess.
I mean, if you don't mind.

32
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,308
All right, you got it? Ah...

33
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,676
No problem.

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,910
Why wouldn't you
just use your other hand?

35
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:11,530
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Hot coffee in my cast!

36
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:12,547
Ah!

37
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,051
Ah...

38
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:16,152
Cold milk.

39
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:17,820
Cold milk.

40
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,055
That's coming out
the bottom.

41
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,156
It is coming out the bottom
of my cast.

42
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:21,391
<i> All right.</i>

Hey.

45
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:46,282
What's going on?

46
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:48,318
Just picked him up on a dozen
counts of identity theft.

47
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:49,886
His name is Doug Judy.

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,388
You ever seen him before?
No.

53
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,364
I think he's into me.

54
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,632
What do you do
to these perps?

55
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,268
Fear is a powerful
aphrodisiac.

56
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:08,004
Anyway, he said he wants
to speak to "John

57
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,506
or Jack Peralta
or whatever."

58
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:11,641
What does he want
with me?

59
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:13,810
And should I change my name
to Jack Peralta?

60
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,311
That sounds badass.

61
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,914
Jack Peralta, crocodile hunter.

62
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,248
Yeah.

63
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,550
He said he wants a deal.

64
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,819
He has some information about
some dude who steals Pontiacs.

65
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,722
Pontiacs? He knows about
the Pontiac bandit.

66
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:27,623
Listen to me,
he specifically said

67
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:28,825
he knows a guy
who steals Pontiacs?

68
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,226
Yeah, I just said that.
Chill, man.

69
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,095
Okay.

70
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,364
Okay, sorry.

71
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:37,533
M'kay.

72
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,901
<i>Hey, Diaz.</i>

73
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:40,403
Come here
and talk to me.

74
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:42,138
This dude is super horny.

75
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:43,539
Yeah.

76
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:48,344
Ah. Whoa.

77
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,920
<i>Backing up, guys.</i>

78
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,922
Oh, are you? Huh.

79
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,591
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

80
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,192
One of these buttons...

81
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:04,861
Sorry, sorry.

82
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,429
Oh, you don't have to apologize
for anything, Boyle.

83
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:07,997
You were shot
in the line of duty,

84
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,732
defending a fellow
officer.

85
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,368
You know, the doctor said
that if the bullet

86
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:14,070
was two millimeters
to the left

87
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,606
and a foot higher, I might
never have walked again.

88
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,441
Everyone here appreciates
your heroism, Boyle.

89
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,209
We all want your
first day back

90
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,779
to be as pleasant and
as comfortable as possible.

91
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,980
Right, detectives?

92
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,415
Absolutely.

93
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,284
Hey, Boyle. You want to choose
where we order lunch from today?

94
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:31,287
Really? You're lifting
the lifetime ban?

95
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,389
I thought my
lunch choices were

96
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,858
"horrifying
adventures in diarrhea."

97
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:37,193
Today, Charles, we take
that adventure with you.

98
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,694
<i>All right!</i>

99
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,229
I've been craving
Sudanese all day.

100
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,465
<i>I'll print out some menus.</i>

101
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,967
Ouch.

102
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,003
You ran over my foot.

103
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:50,440
I am in incredible pain.

104
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,341
I used to work
at a chop shop.

105
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:55,745
It was chill.
Decent hours, good benefits.

106
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,047
You could work
while you were High.

107
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,082
Which I never did,
'cause that's irresponsible.

108
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,018
Anyway, we did a lot
of work for this dude

109
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,786
who stole Pontiacs.

110
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,154
The Pontiac bandit!

111
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:09,091
Okay. We called him bill,
but whatever.

112
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,627
No, not whatever. The Pontiac
bandit is my Nemesis.

113
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,329
I've been chasing
this guy for eight years.

114
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,498
He's stolen hundreds of cars,
all of them Pontiacs.

115
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:16,866
<i>He's never left
any evidence,</i>

116
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,301
and he's never
been caught on Cam

117
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:19,302
the guy is a ghost.

118
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,303
Super ghost.

119
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,304
He's a super ghost!

120
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:22,505
Before we go any further,

121
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:23,706
we need to know
if you're for real.

122
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,774
Describe the guy.

123
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:25,774
<i>Asian dude.</i>

124
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,677
Maybe 5'8",
spiky black hair.

125
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:31,013
Rocks in both ears.
Always wears a black suit.

126
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:32,615
And speaks with
a British accent.

127
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:36,319
Like my girl Dame Judi Dench.
I have impeccable taste.

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,454
So would you say
he looks sort of like...

129
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:39,455
This?

130
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,923
That's bill.

131
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,458
This is a composite sketch
from ten interviews I've done.

132
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,626
Perfect match.

133
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,662
So all you know is what
a bunch of other mopes

134
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:47,663
have said over the years.

135
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,131
Anything else?

136
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:52,335
Yeah. I know how to get
in touch with him.

137
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:55,705
Doug Judy!

138
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,507
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

139
00:04:57,508 --> 00:05:00,309
My husband's dog cheddar had
relations with our neighbor dog

140
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,879
karate and produced
these two smaller dogs

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,616
he insisted that I find them a
good home with someone we trust.

142
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,852
You can trust me.

143
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,754
Dogs are my whole life.

144
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,122
Also work.

145
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,324
Doing work
and hanging with dogs.

146
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,593
That's my lifestyle.

147
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,665
You're allergic to dogs,
aren't you? Nope.

148
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,700
I just need an epipen
because my happiness

149
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,402
is making my throat close up.

150
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:29,805
Hand me the small dog,
Santiago.

151
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,746
So the burner phone
that Doug Judy used

152
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,915
to contact the Pontiac bandit
is at his mom's house.

153
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,683
He's agreed to help us
catch the bandit

154
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,085
if we drop all charges
against him.

155
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:45,354
How many cars would you say
this Pontiac bandit has stolen?

156
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:47,089
230 that I know of.

157
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,025
But the real number could be
in the millions.

158
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:51,027
You're not very good
at math.

159
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,728
What are the charges
against Judy?

160
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:53,963
12 counts of identity theft,

161
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,531
but I've been chasing him
for a month.

162
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,099
Oh, a month?

163
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,235
I've been trying to catch the
Pontiac bandit for eight years.

164
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,269
You know how many
months that is?

165
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,270
96.

166
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:03,339
80... 40... and 6
years, months.

167
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,907
Do you need a math tutor?

168
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,375
Because the department
will provide one for you.

169
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:07,743
I can't tell if
you're being serious.

170
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,278
I'm on the fence here.

171
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,881
Diaz caught him.

172
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,082
It's your call.

173
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,218
Look, this guy is for real.
1,000 push-ups.

174
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,054
1,000 push-ups, really?
Yes.

175
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,923
Okay. I'm in.

176
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,858
<i>What's 1,000 push-ups?</i>

177
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,193
Oh, we were in
the academy together,

178
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,628
and we hated
all the drills, so now

179
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,630
when we're on a case and
one of us says 1,000 push-ups,

180
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,532
it means I'm so sure I'm right

181
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,133
that if I'm wrong,
I'll do 1,000 push-ups.

182
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:32,501
<i>It's a pact we made.</i>

183
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,670
It really just means
"trust me." And I do.

184
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:36,105
<i>Okay.</i>

185
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,940
Make the deal.
Yes!

186
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:41,277
I've got you now,
Pontiac bandit. Whoo!

187
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,245
Feels good to finally say that
in front of actual people

188
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:44,347
instead of just the mirror.

189
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,239
All right, so we grab
the burner, catch the bandit,

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,141
become police legends.

191
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,177
My mom's car is here.
She's home.

192
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,212
Can I take these cuffs off?

193
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,213
No way.

194
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,581
She doesn't know
I'm a criminal.

195
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,317
She thinks I own an architecture
firm with all white employees.

196
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,818
That's racist.

197
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,487
Why stop there? Why not tell her
you're an astronaut?

198
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,289
'Cause space is scary.

199
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,623
You saw what it did
to Sandy bullock.

200
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,091
Yeah, I'm with him
on this one.

201
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,493
I'll stay on earth,
thank you very much.

202
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,495
Yeah.

203
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,896
Come on, Rosa.

204
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,765
We can play-act with his mom
for two minutes to get a lead.

205
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,833
Fine.

206
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,537
One false move, and I tase you
in front of your mom.

207
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,642
Dougie!
Oh, my beautiful boy.

208
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,445
Well, shouldn't you be
at work?

209
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,814
Never too busy to see my mama. Oh.

210
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:34,185
Mama, this is
my girlfriend Rosa.

211
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:37,488
And this is my
personal assistant.

212
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,324
Mangy Carl.

213
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,893
Aw, it's nice to meet you.
You can just call me Carl.

214
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,995
Mangy Carl used to be
a homeless gentleman.

215
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,596
I work with a charity
that finds jobs

216
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,498
for down-on-their-luck
white people.

217
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh...

218
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,670
He's just a big, old angel.
He's been so good to...

219
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,938
The whites.

220
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,441
Yes, he is.

221
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,042
Yeah.
This guy.

222
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,042
Aw...

223
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,280
Hey, speaking of which, we
should probably grab that phone,

224
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,516
you know, so you can
get back to architecturals.

225
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,085
Yes, it's in
the spare bedroom.

226
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,620
I'll go with you.
It's a mess.

227
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,155
Actually, we can handle it
on our own, ma'am.

228
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,190
Thank you so much.

229
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,026
Why don't you just
stay up here and...

230
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,762
Chop it up with Rosa?

231
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,364
Well, that sounds nice.

232
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,835
We can get to know
each other a little.

233
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,568
I love getting
to know people.

234
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,869
It's my jam.

235
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,939
Oh, how good is this food?

236
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,607
I'm eating it.

237
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,509
They accidentally
put a stone in mine.

238
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,545
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that's the hoof!

239
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,581
That's the best
part of the stew!

240
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:38,949
Oh, man.

241
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:42,252
Think of it as marrow nugget
wrapped in a thick toenail.

242
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:44,922
<i>Mmm.</i>

243
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,490
Hey, did I tell you guys
what the doctor said?

244
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,491
Mm-hmm.

245
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:48,992
Couple times.

246
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:51,295
But we'd love
to hear it again.

247
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,764
He said that if the bullet was a
fraction of an inch to the left

248
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,767
and two feet up,
it woulda hit my brain.

249
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,368
Oh...
Yeah.

250
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:01,939
Oh...

251
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,477
"Back in the game.
When can we meet?"

252
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:09,646
Damn, you're a good assistant.
I could get used to this.

253
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:10,848
How long till he usually
gets back to you?

254
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,217
Like ten minutes.
Chill, mangy.

255
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,018
I can't chill. I've never
been this close before.

256
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,122
I gotta admit, your enthusiasm
makes me want you to catch him.

257
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,957
Thank you.

258
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,458
Are these laserdiscs?

259
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,893
Yeah, I robbed
a tower records back in '92.

260
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,428
Kept my faves.

261
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,430
Doug Judy.
Ooh.

262
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,699
<i>Blade runner, tron,</i> oh!

263
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,933
<i>Fievel goes west?</i>

264
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,302
Yes, sir.
Love that little mouse.

265
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,338
His journey...
The story of America.

266
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,873
I could not agree more.

267
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,941
Fievel?
Papa.

268
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,810
Fievel!
Papa!

269
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,179
Fie-vel!
Pa-pa!

270
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,180
Fie-vel!

271
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,181
You guys having fun?

272
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,415
Hey.
'Cause I'm not.

273
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,851
His mom put this stupid
braid in my hair.

274
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:48,852
Oh, looks beautiful.

275
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,688
Yeah, it's kinda cute.

276
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,524
Please have my children.

277
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,227
It's him.

278
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:59,663
Parking lot on Flatbush
and Vanderbilt in 15 minutes.

279
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,025
Let's go. <i> Wait, wait, wait.</i>

280
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,699
Diaz looks like
a dirty criminal.

281
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,767
But you look like a cop, man.

282
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:04,768
You can't go over there
like that.

283
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,971
What'd you have in mind?

284
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,740
♪ Don't call it a comeback

291

I don't look

292
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,391
No, you look like
a Boyz II Men Easter album.

293
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,659
Burn.

294
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,627
That's not a burn,
that's cool.

295
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,964
Gina, we've been
looking all over for you.

296
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,432
You can't just disappear

297
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,901
and leave a sign on your desk
that says, "gone leavin'."

298
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,036
<i>I'm hiding from Charles.</i>

299
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,038
I can't take him anymore.

300
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,639
<i>It's safe in here</i>

301
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,542
'cause his scooter can't get up
the steps in the hallway.

302
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,777
Gina, have some compassion.

303
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,679
Boyle got hurt
doing something brave.

304
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,481
You didn't have to do
physical therapy with him, Amy.

305
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,084
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

306
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,054
Pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, push.

307
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,456
All this cycling makes me
feel like Lance Armstrong.

308
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,491
Like you use
performance-enhancing drugs

309
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,926
and have one teste?

310
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,561
Wouldn't you like to know?

311
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,897
How long can you
possibly hide in here?

312
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,632
I sent all the Captain's
calls here,

313
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,834
my phone battery's
at 100% charge,

314
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,970
and I have ten loose
diner mints in my purse.

315
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,539
This is my home now.

316
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:18,942
I gotta say,
the suit is growing on me.

317
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:19,942
Looks good.

318
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,889
Is it triple-breasted
somehow?

319
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:22,946
There's no such thing.

320
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,681
What about the girl
in <i>total recall?</i>

321
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,984
Mmm. Triple bitties.

322
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,785
Triple bitties.
Triple bitties. Yeah.

323
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:29,786
Rosa...

324
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:31,922
There's no sign of anyone.

325
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:32,923
<i>You sure about this?</i>

326
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:33,957
1,000 push-ups.

327
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,260
Okay.

328
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,062
Heads up.

329
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,466
Who the hell are you?
Where's bill?

330
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,800
He hadn't heard
from you in a while,

331
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,736
so he sent me to make sure
everything was cool.

332
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:46,837
Apparently it's not.

333
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,205
Who are they?

334
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,406
They're with me.

335
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:52,109
This is the buyer. Carl Mangerman.
'Sup?

336
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,177
I don't know them,
I don't trust them.

337
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:56,647
He meets with you alone
or it's off.

338
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,382
I'll text the address.

339
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:02,619
Come on!

340
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:03,987
I promise you this.

341
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:07,658
They have not heard the last
of Carl mangerman.

342
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,995
Sergeant, I'd like you
to meet Richard and Dan.

343
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:12,996
They are puppies.

344
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,865
Very cute, sir.

345
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,501
Maybe your twins would like
some little, furry friends.

346
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:20,237
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's impossible.

347
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,571
With the twins
learning how to walk,

348
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:23,607
chaos reigns
at the Jeffords household.

349
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,977
I can't let those innocent
pups into that madhouse.

350
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,578
Terry won't do you like that.

351
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:29,613
<i>I understand.</i>

352
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:33,383
Just know you have
disappointed...

353
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,086
All three of us.

354
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,190
That's cold, sir.

355
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,492
All right,
it's worth the risk.

356
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,261
We send him in alone.

357
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,463
No, we do not. Something
doesn't smell right to me.

358
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,498
Could be my dad's suit.
He died in it.

359
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,532
He died in it?

360
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:53,370
Oh, man.

361
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,439
They just sent the location.

362
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,307
<i>Man, this dude is cautious.</i>

363
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,042
If I show up one minute late
or I'm not alone,

364
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,577
he's done with me.

365
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,045
This is your last shot.

366
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,880
I can't let the Pontiac bandit
get away.

367
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,316
Put a wire on him, get
a tactical team in as backup.

368
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:07,684
It's the only way.

369
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,219
Doug Judy and I know this guy.
You have to trust us.

370
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
Do I?

371
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,355
One of you is a criminal,

372
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,756
and the other one
is dressed like Steve Harvey.

373
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,877
It's over.
I'm ending this now.

374
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:15,892
Sorry, Jake.

375
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,728
Seriously?

376
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,663
Yeah. 1,000 push-ups.

377
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,565
Well, I raise you.
2,000 push-ups.

378
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,500
What?
That's not how this works.

379
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,168
I said 1,000 push-ups,
you have to back me up.

380
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,470
That's the pact,
end of story.

381
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,904
Well, I break the pact.

382
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,707
I hope you understand
how serious this is to me.

383
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,842
Come on, Rosa.

384
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,344
Can't you read
between the lines, man?

385
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,612
Don't quote <i>die hard.</i>

386
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:36,947
Sorry.

387
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,515
But we're still
sending him in alone.

388
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,123
<i>We need evidence,
so get him talking.</i>

389
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,293
Ask questions about money,
cars, specifics.

390
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,096
I'm getting kind of nervous,
man. This dude is for real.

391
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,230
You sure you got
everything covered?

392
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:50,364
Yeah.

393
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:52,100
<i>There's a body
on the back door,</i>

394
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,668
<i>eyes on the side door,</i>

395
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,670
<i>and two guys out on the corner.
You're gonna be fine.</i>

396
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,738
What about choppers?

397
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:59,040
You got choppers?
With snipers and rockets?

398
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,875
No one has
rocket choppers.

399
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:04,746
Although that does
sound amazing.

400
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,347
So, what'd I miss?

401
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,217
Tell me all the jokes.
Everything funny that happened.

402
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,619
Charles, we really
need to get back to...

403
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,521
Hitchcock called himself
Scully by accident.

404
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,891
I did. But it brought
me and Scully closer together.

405
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:18,226
<i>That's great!</i>

406
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,260
What else?

407
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,495
Oh...

408
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,531
Oh, I laughed too hard.
Lost another highlighter.

409
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,233
Does anyone have
skinny forearms?

410
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,400
Fine.

411
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:29,403
Great.

412
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,608
Yeah, it's way
down there by my butt.

413
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,609
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

414
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,943
Is that it?
Yup.

415
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:36,911
Oh, okay. <i> Right there.</i>

416
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,279
Ah!

417
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,947
Got it.

418
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,650
Oh, my God.
Where's my grandmother's ring?

419
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,752
Oop. Found it.

420
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,754
I'll be right back.

421
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,790
Please get
out of my way. I am physically disabled.

422
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,348
Please get out of my way.

423
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,928
Welcome to
the Boyle-free zone.

424
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,430
<i>Please turn off
all cell phones</i>

425
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:59,734
so as not to attract
any unwanted attention.

426
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,402
Can I offer you a mint?

427
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:04,272
<i>We got eyes on the bandit.
He's a block away.</i>

428
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,940
You ready?

429
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,809
You and me, Jakey.
We were born ready.

430
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:09,243
Go, Judy, go.

431
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:16,317
<i>We meet at last,
Pontiac bandit.</i>

432
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:19,453
For eight years
I've tracked you.

433
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:22,690
And today I'm taking you down.

434
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,772
Doug Judy, can you hear me?

435
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,426
Say something
to test the wire.

436
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:26,494
<i>Hey, Diaz...</i>

437
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,496
After we put the cuffs
on this guy,

438
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,164
I'll be free for dinner.

439
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,666
You like spaghetti?

440
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,135
And weed?

441
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,803
The mic works.

442
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,471
My man. What's up?

443
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,806
<i>Pleasure to see you again.</i>

444
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,174
<i>Let's talk about cars.</i>

445
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,809
<i>I got my shop
up and running again.</i>

446
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,811
<i>I can do anything you want.</i>

447
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:47,181
<i>Blue cars, red cars,
big cars, small cars,</i>

448
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,684
<i>you know, cars. Cars are
really great, aren't they?</i>

449
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,684
What is he doing?

450
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:54,055
Talking about cars.

451
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:59,794
Boyle, where is everyone?

452
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,128
Hiding from me
in the evidence room.

453
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:02,530
They think I don't know,

454
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,031
but Gina's been live
tweeting the whole thing.

455
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,033
She live tweets
everything.

456
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,168
Ruined <i>Downton Abbey</i> for me.

457
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:09,303
Maybe it was too soon
for me to come back.

458
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,838
I would've just
stayed at home,

459
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,173
but I was getting
lonely and bored.

460
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,575
One day I looked
out the window for four hours.

461
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,978
I didn't see anything.

462
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,512
Huh.

463
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,181
<i>You know what
else is great about cars?</i>

464
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:23,017
<i>The way they look.
How they stop, how they start.</i>

465
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,485
That's it. I'm calling it.

466
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,519
No!

467
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,854
Move, people,
we're going in now.

468
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:35,663
On your knees!
Hands on your head!

469
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,398
Gotcha, Pontiac bandit.

470
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:38,799
Where's Doug Judy?

471
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,335
He went to the bathroom.

472
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,370
I'm just here
to give him a haircut.

473
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:43,371
I don't know
what's going on.

474
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:44,739
A likely story, Pontiac...

475
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,974
But actually you do have
a lot of hair products.

476
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,109
He's gone. He ran.

477
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,477
Why would he do that?

478
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,579
He helped us catch the Pontiac
bandit. That was the deal.

479
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,047
Doesn't make
any sense unless...

480
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:54,682
Doug Judy is
the Pontiac bandit.

481
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,251
Put out an APB.

482
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:59,253
Seal off everything
for a 20-block radius.

483
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,888
<i>Yeah,
don't bother looking for me.</i>

484
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,690
I'm in the wind.

485
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,191
<i>If you're close
enough for me to hear you,</i>

486
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,893
you're close enough
for me to catch you.

487
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,929
Nah, I got a relay
set up, brother.

488
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,998
So if you're the Pontiac bandit,
who's this joker?

489
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,000
<i>Couple of years ago
you were getting really close,</i>

490
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,669
so I started telling
all my associates

491
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,371
if they ever get caught,
they should describe me as...

492
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:19,974
Asian dude, 5'8",
spiky hair.

493
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,242
Wears diamond earrings
and has a...

494
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,677
British accent.

495
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:24,545
So then you hired a guy who
matched that exact description.

496
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,880
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

497
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,683
That's my barber Norman Lee.
He gave me the idea.

498
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:30,685
You know, if you can't come in,
I do house calls.

499
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,986
You just text me a location

500
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:34,288
and I could be there
in half an hour.

501
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,890
Good to know.

502
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,825
You know, you should actually
use him while he's there.

503
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,393
He'll give you a dope fade.

504
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:42,029
I get dope enough fades from
my current barber, thank you.

505
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,597
So you dragged us over here,
went in there,

506
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:44,632
pretended to talk, and then
snuck out the basement.

507
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,100
Am I right?

508
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,469
<i>The basement connected
to another basement!</i>

509
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:50,371
Which connected to a garage,

510
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,739
which is where
my boy picked me up.

511
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,108
Your boy?

512
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,142
Oh, that guy from the meet-up.

513
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,610
<i>He works for you.</i>

514
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,279
He pretended to be spooked
by me and Diaz

515
00:17:58,313 --> 00:17:59,847
in the parking lot
to make sure that

516
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,415
we let you go to
the next meeting by yourself.

517
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,184
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

518
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,552
You win a Teddy bear!

519
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,320
You lied to me, Doug Judy.

520
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,990
Gotta be honest, I'm pretty
disappointed right now.

521
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,558
I mean, was that even
really your mom?

522
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,892
<i>Hell yeah, that's my real mom.</i>

523
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:15,196
I wanted to see her one last
time before I disappeared.

524
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,998
I told you I was sensitive,
Rosa.

525
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,332
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>

526
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,434
Why don't you come back here
and take me out to dinner?

527
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,470
Ah...

528
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,038
I know you're
trying to trap me.

529
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,640
But crazy thing is
I'm tempted!

530
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:27,975
That's how hot I find you.

531
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,177
<i>Sorry it had to go down
this way, Peralta.</i>

532
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:32,313
<i>Maybe we could've been
friends in another world.</i>

533
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:33,514
<i>If I hadn't just fooled you</i>

534
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:34,982
like a little bitch!

535
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,587
Bitch!

536
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,299
'Kay.

537
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,424
Hey, Captain,
we thought we'd

538
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,792
get more work done
in here, because...

539
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,460
You're all hiding
from Boyle.

540
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,561
<i>Not me, Captain.</i>

541
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,595
I was napping.

542
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,997
That's worse.

543
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,398
<i>Captain,
we all think Boyle's a hero,</i>

544
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,234
but it's very difficult
to be around him right now.

545
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,903
<i>I was in
the bathroom with him, sir.</i>

546
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,604
It was a nightmare.

547
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:02,772
Hey, sarge,

548
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,541
this cast has a special
crotch hole.

549
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,810
It's like a doggy door
for my penis.

550
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,112
Shake.

551
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,549
That man took a bullet
for this precinct.

552
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,485
He's a guy who's always
looking for love and friendship.

553
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,721
And he needs it now
more than ever.

554
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,589
But you all turned
your backs on him.

555
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,659
And you should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

556
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:27,097
I'm sorry.
Those puppies are so cute.

557
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:29,399
They do undercut
your Tone a bit, sir.

558
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,634
<i>But on the plus side,</i>

559
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,070
I think I know
what to do with them.

560
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,906
<i>Detective Boyle.</i>

561
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:41,444
I think you might be able to
give these dogs a good home.

562
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,146
Ah...

563
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,347
You are off the scooter.

564
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,316
If you have fallen,
please call a doctor.

565
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,884
Oh, Captain...

566
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,285
I don't know
if I should... okay.

567
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
Oh...

568
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,757
That tickles.

569
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:57,293
They like me so much!

570
00:19:58,629 --> 00:19:59,763
Are you crying, Santiago?

571
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,898
I'm so allergic.

572
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,134
Can you tell the scooter
to call an ambulance?

573
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,237
Hey.

574
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,538
So...

575
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,240
I went back to
the mom's house.

576
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,342
Unsurprisingly a dead end.

577
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,210
I got a lot of work
to do, Peralta.

578
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,211
<i>Wait.</i>

579
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,513
<i>I want to say something.</i>

580
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:18,047
We've worked together
long enough that I know

581
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,516
how much you hate apologies.

582
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,118
I just want to ask you
to join the Doug Judy case.

583
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,953
Officially, as partners.

584
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,490
I want to catch this guy,
and I can't do it without you.

585
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:30,226
No, you can't.

586
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,995
Now I bee I owe you
1,000 push-ups.

587
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,663
I don't care about
the push-ups, Jake.

588
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:35,131
I care that you
didn't honor our pact.

589
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:36,566
I've always trusted you,

590
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,901
and when you did that it made me
feel like you don't trust me.

591
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,836
I know, and I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

592
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:40,970
No, it won't.

593
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,772
Now get down on the floor.

594
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,641
What? You just said you didn't
care about the push-ups.

595
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,509
I changed my mind.

596
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,344
Fair enough.

597
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,781
A pact's a pact.

598
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:57,420
One, two, three...

599
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,289
612...

600
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,557
Night, Peralta.

601
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,294
Night.

602
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:07,397
613...

603
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:08,865
Hey, Ronald.

604
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,371
1,000...

605
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:18,508
Is so many push-ups.
I'm never gonna make it.

606
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,876
What am I at?

607
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:21,144
901.

608
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,979
Thank you, Captain.

609
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,347
You said 2,000, remember?

610
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,348
<i>Agh!</i>

611
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,884
I shoulda trusted you!

612
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:31,790

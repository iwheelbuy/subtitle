1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:03,204
Morning, Scully.
How was your weekend?

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:07,308
Oh, fun. Kelly and I hit
the park, went for a long walk.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:08,776
Fell asleep watching TV.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,713
Oh. Sounds like a fun
weekend with Kelly.

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,783
So, Kelly. Is that
Scully's wife or his dog?

6
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,751
Uh...
<i>Wait.</i>

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:18,953
No one knows
Scully's wife's name?

8
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:20,421
I think Kelly is his dog.

9
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,189
Went for a long walk.
That's what you do with a dog.

10
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:24,391
You can go on a long
walk with a person.

11
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,626
At sunset.

12
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:27,728
Talking about nothing.
And everything.

13
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:30,564
Sounds awful.
Hit the park. That's a dog.

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,300
My wife takes the babies
to the park all the time.

15
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,135
All right, we're doing this.

16
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,403
Let's play "wife or dog."

17
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,539
Hey, so Scully,

18
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,674
what do you do
at the park with Kelly?

19
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,209
Oh, we just walk around.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,411
She gets antsy if she doesn't
get outside enough.

21
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:47,448
And then it's just
yap, yap, yap, all day long.

22
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,317
<i>Hey,
what's Kelly's favorite food?</i>

23
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:53,354
Peanut butter. She'll eat it
right out of the jar.

24
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:54,555
How old is Kelly again?

25
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:55,823
Well, she's getting up there,

26
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:57,658
but she's pretty spry
for her age.

27
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,760
Especially considering she got
hit by that car a year ago.

28
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:01,428
Oh, that's so awful.

29
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,264
Was she chasing something
into the street, or...

30
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,766
No. Just getting me
the newspaper.

31
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,468
All right, this is useless.

32
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,003
Scully, is Kelly
your wife or your dog?

33
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:12,606
How can you ask me that?

34
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,508
I still don't know
which it is.

35
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,577
- <i>Could be either.</i>
- I could not tell you.

36
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,374
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

37
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,132
<i>Okay, what do you got?</i>

38
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,134
Yup.

39
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,935
Oh, sir, are you
looking for your glasses?

40
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,138
I borrowed them to do
an impression of you.

41
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,139
It killed.

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,808
Peralta, give me my glasses.

43
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,044
Peralta, give me back
my glasses.

44
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,145
Okay.

45
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,680
All right, lay out
the steroids case.

46
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,281
It's a major operation.

47
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,516
And one of the biggest
black market distributors

48
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,817
in all of Brooklyn.

49
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,487
And it's centered at a gym
called Brooklyn total body.

50
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,539
The center of our investigation
is a guy named Brandon jacoby.

51
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,392
<i>He did seven years
at Rikers for assault.</i>

52
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:10,564
We spent two weeks undercover
infiltrating the gym.

53
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,933
"Gym-filtrating" it.
I coined that.

54
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,669
I think it'll really catch on
if more people infiltrated gyms.

55
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,872
We believe that jacoby can
link us to the distributors,

56
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,375
but he only talks to trainers
and other muscle heads.

57
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,310
So we want to
bring in the sarge.

58
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:25,045
<i>His name will be
Trent Carter.</i>

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,380
A personal trainer, bouncer,

60
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,049
and assistant manager
at petsmart.

61
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,784
It's the economy.
What can you do?

62
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,486
Gentlemen, have a seat.

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,788
Sergeant Jeffords is just
getting back in the field.

64
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:35,789
What if he panics again?

65
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,658
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

66
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,660
I mean, he saved your life
at the rail yard.

67
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,529
Okay. It's your case.

68
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,298
But if anything goes wrong,
it's on you.

69
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,900
Trust me, the sergeant
will be fine.

70
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,902
If you want to worry about
anyone panicking in the field

71
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,003
it should be Boyle.

72
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,039
Damn straight.

73
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
Wait, why'd
high five that?

74
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,842
'Cause you're a sucker
for a high five.

75
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:58,011
Damn straight I am.

76
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,381
Captain, I need a favor.

77
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,483
My apartment got
broken into last night.

78
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,251
Gina, that's terrible.
Are you okay?

79
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,587
I'm fine,
but I suffered the loss

80
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,389
of many treasured items.

81
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,091
<i>Such as my grandma's jewelry,
some cash,</i>

82
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,963
and this very fancy gown
with, like, a magic eye print.

83
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,265
Do you have any connections
in the FBI or CIA?

84
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,901
There's no one else I can
turn to to solve this crime.

85
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,403
Gina, you work
in a police precinct.

86
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,404
You can turn
to anyone here.

87
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:25,205
You think these
buffoons can help?

88
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,240
They're buffoons.

89
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,741
They are not buffoons.

90
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:30,277
Try the heel.

91
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,414
Still don't feel anything.

92
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,183
Awesome. I wish I had
nerve damage.

93
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,419
Some of them are buffoons.

94
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,587
But I'll find the non-buffoons
to investigate.

95
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:43,590
Could you ask Scully
to return my thumbtacks?

96
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,292
I already put 'em
in a biohazard bag

97
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,760
and tossed 'em
in the furnace.

98
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,795
Good call.

99
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,496
You ready, sarge?

100
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:50,664
I was born ready.

101
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,866
And then I was not
born ready for a while,

102
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,435
but now I'm back
to being born ready.

103
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:57,004
Yes! The ebony falcon
soars again.

104
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,338
The ebony falcon.

105
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,307
His feathers are muscles.

106
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,543
Let's talk strategy
later tonight at my house.

107
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:04,611
My wife's working late,
I'm on daddy duty.

108
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,946
But you're ready
for this, right?

109
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,381
Absolutely.

110
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,784
I just need to put my precious
babies to bed with a story.

111
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,588
The ebony falcon needs
to read <i>go, dog, go.</i>

112
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,823
Yeah, he does.

113
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,674
Terry Jeffords is back!
Chest bump me.

114
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,692
You don't want
to do this, man.

115
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,693
No, I really do.

116
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,794
It hurts you every time.

117
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,929
No, I know, but I'm fired up.

118
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,230
The adrenaline is gonna
carry me through.

119
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,298
Here we go.

120
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:32,406
No signs of forced entry
at the door.

121
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:33,807
But the window was jimmied.

122
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,142
You don't have locks
on your windows.

123
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,577
Way to blame the victim.

124
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:38,979
Sorry I'm not rich
like you, miss 1%.

125
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,882
They cost $8.
You have a fur bedspread.

126
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:44,184
Why do you have so many
lycra bodysuits?

127
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,820
And why do you need eight
full drawers of underwear?

128
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,822
Because I'm civilized.

129
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,958
Less talky-talk,
more solvey-solve.

130
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:53,026
We need an itemized list
of everything that was stolen.

131
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:54,628
I already gave it
to Captain Holt.

132
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:58,499
$160 in cash, one TV,

133
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,201
one large painting
of a naked lady on a lion,

134
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,837
<i>one set of Joseph Gordon-levitt
nesting dolls...</i>

135
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:04,838
Wow.

136
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,840
Homemade and irreplaceable.

137
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,575
One music box that plays

138
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,345
<i>she works hard for the money</i>
when opened.

139
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,579
One knockoff
designer clutch...

140
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,181
Can't you just buy
another knockoff?

141
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,250
No, I can't, silly sue.

142
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,719
'Cause the label no longer
makes the original,

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,021
so the sweatshop no longer
makes the knockoff.

144
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,857
Can you estimate the value
of everything that was taken?

145
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:28,829
Emotionally, $700 million.

146
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,232
Somebody at the door.
Yeah.

147
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,232
<i>Hey, sarge.</i>

148
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,102
Sorry about the mess.

149
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,236
<i>Hi, Cagney. Hi, Lacey.</i>

150
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,906
Hey, your kids like
the same kind of cereal as me.

151
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,207
Well, we just
finished story time.

152
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,075
I'm gonna kiss
the girls night-night,

153
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,744
then we can get down
to business.

154
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,079
All right,
time for night-night, girls.

155
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,882
He is so strong
but so gentle.

156
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,652
He's like an enormous,
muscular Ellen Degeneres.

157
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,254
You know, I just want
to let you guys know

158
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,924
that I love you girls
so, so muc

159
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,725
okay? So sleep tight.

160
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,828
You know, daddy will never
leave you, right, girls?

161
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,564
<i>Night-night, daddy.</i>

162
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:06,767
Gosh. Really makes you
understand what he went through.

163
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,435
I'm worried about Terry.

164
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,638
We can't let anything bad
happen to him.

165
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:14,927
Jake, where are you?

166
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:18,330
In here.

167
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,732
Oh...

168
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,634
This is a classy tepee.

169
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,502
Should we get these
instead of desks at work?

170
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:25,004
We have to get Terry
off this case.

171
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,105
What? Why?

172
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,473
Look, I thought
he was a weirdo

173
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,642
for having his year-long
freak-out, but I get it now.

174
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,111
He has children. What happens
to them if he gets hurt?

175
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:33,379
I'll have to
take care of them.

176
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:36,182
Or his wife or other family
or his more mature friends,

177
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:37,516
but interesting point.

178
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:39,018
Why is this just
hitting you now?

179
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:41,020
I don't know, I guess I just
hadn't seen his kids in so long

180
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,322
he never takes them around
the precinct for some reason.

181
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,191
Because of
all the guns and danger.

182
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,460
If you have concerns, maybe you
should talk to Terry about it.

183
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,161
No. And you can't either.

184
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:50,663
If he finds out
we're worried about him,

185
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,064
it'll get in his head
and freak him out.

186
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,432
He'll lose his edge
and panic.

187
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,234
Yeah, that's why I've never
tried to develop an edge.

188
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,502
You can't lose
what you don't have.

189
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,503
No surprises.

190
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,604
What are you guys
talking about?

191
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,139
Work. International
taxes and tariffs.

192
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,740
Work.

193
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:02,741
Heh.

194
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,976
<i>So...</i>

195
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,344
What's the plan at the gym?

196
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,545
Well, I say
we slow-play it.

197
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:07,546
You know?

198
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,647
Do a little more setup,

199
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,982
a little surveillance,

200
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,651
wait a couple months and see
if they turn themselves in.

201
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:14,587
Listen, man, I know
everybody's worried about me

202
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,388
being psychologically
ready for this.

203
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,157
But I promise you I am.

204
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,525
No matter what happens,

205
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,193
no matter how many
bullets are flying,

206
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:23,996
I'm gonna be right there
in the middle of everything.

207
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:25,898
<i>I got your back.</i>

208
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,602
No, it's not even that,
you know, it's just...

209
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,437
Well, frankly, I'm not so sure
that everyone at the gym

210
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:32,838
is gonna buy you as a trainer.

211
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,753
You've been sitting behind
that desk for so long

212
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,075
you've gotten
a little tubby.

213
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,143
Right? It's like,
love handle alert!

214
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,645
Do you have a bone
there somehow?

215
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,816
Jake, I promise.
I'm good.

216
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,251
Oops.

217
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,654
I gotta put this stuffed giraffe
between my two girls.

218
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:52,124
They both like to snuggle
against his head.

219
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,359
Here comes Mr. snuggles.

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,895
Here comes
Mr. snuggles.

221
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:59,999
Okay, thanks.

222
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,701
Crime tech report from
your apartment came back.

223
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,270
Apparently they found
a strand of hair

224
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:05,771
belonging to Mario Lopez.

225
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,873
I bought a lock of his hair
at an auction.

226
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,042
That's cool it's real.

227
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:11,410
What'd they say
about the prints?

228
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,112
None of the partials
returned any matches.

229
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,581
Nobody in your building
saw anything. We've hit a wall.

230
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,949
So what do we do next?

231
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,018
Do I just look
for another apartment?

232
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,853
Should I buy a handgun?

233
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,454
Should I buy
a shotgun?

234
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:23,656
Should I buy an uzi?

235
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,292
Look, Gina,
we've done all we can.

236
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,893
This is how it goes
with most B and es.

237
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,962
Mm. All right.

238
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,298
C'est la vie. Let me grab
your badge numbers.

239
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:33,599
'Cause I will be filing

240
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,701
an official civilian
complaint with the Captain.

241
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,839
Why did I just receive

242
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,201
a civilian complaint
about you two?

243
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,709
I can answer this.

244
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,844
Because your assistant
is a goblin.

245
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,313
Captain, we swept the scene,
ran the prints,

246
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:51,517
canvassed the building.
We followed procedure.

247
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:56,121
"Procedure" is just a fancy word
for proper order to do things.

248
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,090
Yes, that is it's definition.

249
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,159
This is a miscarriage
of justice.

250
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,994
I'm gonna haunt your dreams.

251
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:11,537
You sure you can lift
this much weight?

252
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:13,439
Are you kidding me?

253
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,975
I was the strongest kid in
my camp seven summers in a row.

254
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:17,309
It would've been eight

255
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,078
if that freak Rebecca Lobelman
hadn't showed up.

256
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:21,313
Let's put in work.

257
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:22,314
And here we go.

258
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,349
One.

259
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,017
And I'm done. That's it.

260
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,019
Oh, good rep.
Don't wanna get too bulky.

261
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,388
Two things.

262
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,423
First, this gym's wipe-down
policy is criminally lax.

263
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:32,591
So I rewrote it.

264
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,059
Second, I lowered
the temperature

265
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,594
of the water fountain
by two degrees.

266
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,129
Still waiting on feedback,

267
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,765
but I see a lot
of refreshed faces.

268
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,327
Also Brandon jacoby
should be here soon.

269
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,335
How was that not
one of your two things?

270
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,037
I gave his regular trainer
the day off,

271
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:47,272
I told him Trent
would be filling in.

272
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:50,142
It was an interesting
interaction.

273
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,911
Well, according to my new
cloud-based scheduling system,

274
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:55,681
your trainer is out,
and Trent will be filling in.

275
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:02,755
I spent 40 minutes making that
water bottle pyramid display.

276
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,223
This guy is a psycho.

277
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:06,025
You know the best way
to deal with psychos.

278
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:08,961
The silent treatment. We should
draw him out by not engaging.

279
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,396
Nope.

280
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:12,531
The longer we wait the more
likely our cover gets blown.

281
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,999
I'll make contact.

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,367
Okay, but just remember.

283
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,970
You're not Terry.
You're Trent.

284
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:22,207
Trainer and known hemophiliac,
so be careful.

285
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,177
Trent is also a quaker who
avoids violence at all costs.

286
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:31,083
You Trent?

287
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:35,154
Yup. A black Trent.
One of many.

288
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:36,922
Uh, what do you want
to start with today?

289
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,824
Weights.

290
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,626
Excuse me, sir.
Can I borrow this machine?

291
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,695
I need to be here to keep
an eye on a friend.

292
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,365
Hold on. I'm on my last set.

293
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,366
Okay.

294
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:51,303
Two...

295
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:52,738
Three...

296
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,273
Can you go any faster?

297
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,474
I mean, what do you need
leg muscles for anyway?

298
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,809
You're, like, 100 years old.

299
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,944
Socially acceptable for you
to roll around on a scooter.

300
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:02,247
I lost the count.

301
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:03,248
One.

302
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:04,248
One?

303
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:06,785
<i>You're not even moving.
Let's go.</i>

304
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,454
Get your hands off me!

305
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,155
I've heard about this
in the news!

306
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,024
You're cyber-bullying me!
Shh!

307
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,559
I'm getting the manager!
Get the hell away from me!

308
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,961
No, you're very misinformed.
Please don't...

309
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,262
Damn it.

310
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,222
Hey. Have you seen Terry?
I lost him.

311
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,157
His children could be
orphans already.

312
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,360
Fatherless,
mother-having orphans.

313
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,195
I'm sure he's fine.

314
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,097
I think the bigger issue
is the complaint I received

315
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,465
from an older gentleman

316
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,200
saying you tried to
hurry him off his machine,

317
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,868
in open defiance
of gym protocol.

318
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,069
Don't do this.

319
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,572
I know we're friends,
but if you do that again,

320
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,873
I'm gonna have to
suspend your membership.

321
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,141
What have you become?

322
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,609
Me. I've become me.

323
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,610
What?

324
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh, sarge, thank God.

325
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,680
Where were you?
What happened?

326
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,850
Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted
to do wind sprints outside.

327
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,652
You know, he's a mean dude,
but I think I'm making progress.

328
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,022
He asked to borrow
my squat belt, I told him no,

329
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,323
he respected that.

330
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,992
Okay, but let's build up
that relationship slowly, okay?

331
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,528
We don't want to
jump the gun and spook him.

332
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,430
<i>Whew!</i>

333
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,799
'Sup?
Good workout.

334
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,002
You know, it's weird I never
worked out with you before.

335
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,437
What'd you say
your regular gym was?

336
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,007
I didn't.
Brooklyn bulk fitness.

337
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,409
Huh?

338
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,443
I work out there too.

339
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,112
<i>Never heard of any Trent.</i>

340
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,448
I don't know why.
I work out there all the time.

341
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,917
Really? Starting when?

342
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,219
NYPD, hands on your head!
My God, you're gigantic.

343
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,822
What are you doing, Peralta?
You just blew my cover!

344
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,424
Or did I save your life?

345
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,626
Or did you compromise
an investigation

346
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,428
and piss off
a superior officer?

347
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,596
I'm sensing from your tone
it's that one.

348
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,266
<i>I need some afternoon coffee.</i>

349
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,501
What's the matter with you?

350
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,571
Gina came by my house last night
to go over the case.

351
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,641
Between us doing that and her
using my bread maker all night,

352
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,876
I didn't get much sleep.

353
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,145
I will say she makes
a wonderful rye.

354
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,381
So dense, yet so moist.

355
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,383
Hello, ladies.

356
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,118
<i>Since you have allowed
crime to win,</i>

357
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:10,389
I've hired a private
investigator to solve my case.

358
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,291
Say hello to Leo Sporm.

359
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,327
A P.I.?
These guys are hacks.

360
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,963
How do you know if your
husband's a murderer?

361
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,065
You don't.

362
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>Call Leo now.</i>

363
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,635
Leo Sporm.

364
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,970
<i>How's business?</i>

365
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,004
You know this guy?

366
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>Everyone knows him.</i>

367
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,308
The Picasso of hucksters.

368
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,809
I like that.

369
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,645
"Look up who Picasso is."

370
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,114
Sporm. Out.

371
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,816
<i>Now.</i>

372
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,017
You blew our cover, man!

373
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,353
Now I gotta go into an
interrogation with no evidence

374
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,622
and try to get jacoby
to rat out his distributors!

375
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,157
I'm sorry, I got jumpy.

376
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,092
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was all the exercise.

377
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,994
The blood from my head
rushed into my delts.

378
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,897
Point to your delts, Jake.

379
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,799
There is...

380
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,334
You didn't have to
hop in there, man.

381
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,303
I can handle this.

382
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,304
What's my name?

383
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,305
Terry Jeffords.

384
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,840
What is my name?

385
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,874
The ebony falcon.

386
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,776
And what does
the ebony falcon do?

387
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,679
Takes every precaution to
ensure his own safety?

388
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,149
Takes bad guys to jail
and bad girls to bed.

389
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,583
Hell yeah, he does.

390
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,285
Except now the ebony falcon
is monogamous

391
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,287
and too tired for sex,
so his only indulgence

392
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:20,292
is fresh fruit
yogurt parfaits.

393
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,161
Terry loves yogurt.

394
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,196
How's it going?

395
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,365
Well, so far jacoby
hasn't given anything up,

396
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,833
but I think Terry's
starting to get to him.

397
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,001
I'm not talking.

398
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,836
You're talking right now!

399
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,970
Boom!

400
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,841
I'm already in your head.

401
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,342
Sarge is safe in there,

402
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,044
so the longer this
interrogation goes the better.

403
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,046
We gotta solve the case
before he does.

404
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,948
Hey, tell me about that new
system you set up at the gym

405
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,316
for scheduling appointments.

406
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,451
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say those words.

407
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,719
Come with me.

408
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,657
Experience the future
of cloud-based scheduling.

409
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,824
Okay.

410
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,060
I put all
the trainers' schedules

411
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,828
into a shared online calendar.

412
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,997
Aside from the cucumber water
at the front desk,

413
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,233
it's probably my greatest
accomplishment ever.

414
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,202
Hang on a sec.
Who's this guy?

415
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,903
Says he's a personal
trainer at the gym,

416
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,572
but he has no regular hours.

417
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,106
He always makes
last-minute appointments,

418
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,475
always in the boxing area,
and always late at night.

419
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,377
And look who he trains.

420
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,545
Brandon jacoby.

421
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,947
That's probably
our supplier.

422
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,249
We should set up a buy
from this Vladimir Rincic.

423
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,085
All right. We should set up
a tactical team and hit the gym.

424
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,520
And sergeant Jeffries
should stay here

425
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,622
and keep interrogating jacoby
for as many hours

426
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,390
or years as necessary.

427
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,025
Are you sure
I shouldn't go get him?

428
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,361
I feel a little uncomfortable
leaving him out of this.

429
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,696
Don't think of it
as leaving him out

430
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,764
so much as including his babies
in having a father.

431
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,865
Let's go.

432
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,866
<i>Detectives.</i>

433
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,968
Where are you going?

434
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,869
Just headed out
to close the steroid case.

435
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,072
Isn't sergeant Jeffries
interrogating the suspect now?

436
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,473
Yup, he's got that
locked up.

437
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,141
We're following up
on this lead.

438
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,410
The whole team is running
smoothly and perfectly

439
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,581
like a well-lubed,
oiled time clock... bye.

440
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,384
<i>Why do you think
Gina hired that P.I.?</i>

441
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,619
To mock us.

442
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,787
She's scared.

443
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,155
She's not scared.

444
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,292
With all due respect, sir,
Gina has no feelings.

445
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,361
She once said
the best comedy of all time

446
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,296
was <i>the girl
with the dragon tattoo.</i>

447
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,131
Well, think about
how she's been acting.

448
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,133
Gina came by my house
last night.

449
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,468
Do I buy an uzi?

450
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,437
I asked for a police officer
to escort me to work,

451
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,539
and it took a while
for dispatch to find me

452
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,808
a young Kevin costner type.

453
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,745
Her home doesn't
feel safe anymore.

454
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,246
If someone broke
into your apartment

455
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,915
and you weren't cops,
wouldn't you be scared?

456
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,018
Yes.

457
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,487
Depends. How many guns
do I still have hidden?

458
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,488
None.

459
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,024
Do I still have my knife?
Nunchucks?

460
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,325
Axe?

461
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,761
It was a hypothetical
question.

462
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,562
I know, but I want
to play it out.

463
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,431
Do I still have
my throwing stars?

464
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,967
This has taken
a strange turn.

465
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,136
Fine. I'd be scared.

466
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,471
<i>We're on it.</i>

467
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,774
What kind of woman
doesn't have an axe?

468
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,678
All right, we're all set
for the sting.

469
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,646
<i>We got hidden cameras,
wireless mics,</i>

470
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,348
and tactical teams
by all the exits.

471
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,517
I told Vladimir to meet
Vance Vandervaven,

472
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,185
a.K.A. me, here at 10:00.

473
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,853
Said that I was
filling in for jacoby.

474
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,689
You and I will be sparring
when he arrives.

475
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,924
Cool.
I boxed at the academy.

476
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,693
They invented a new
weight class for me.

477
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,529
You're looking at the undisputed
bubbleweight champion.

478
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,863
<i>Hey! Peralta!</i>

479
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,665
Boyle!
Sarge, hey.

480
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,434
I'm so psyched you
made it here to the sting

481
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,370
that I definitely told
Charles to tell you about.

482
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,371
You lied to me!

483
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,872
I can see that
you're upset,

484
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,474
but let's just sit down
and talk about it.

485
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,876
Done talking!

486
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,079
Time to dance.

487
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,147
Fine. But I should warn you.

488
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,849
I took three years of tap.

489
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:38,079
Again, sarge,
it's so good to see you.

490
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:40,481
Just out of curiosity,
how did you find out about this?

491
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:43,785
I'm a Detective sergeant
in the NYPD.

492
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:46,621
Holt told me. Why are you
cutting me out of the operation?

493
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,289
What? That's crazy!

494
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,590
Boyle, come in here
and stand in front of my body

495
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,292
and tell him that's crazy.

496
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:53,327
Ow! My lucky face!

497
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,063
You gonna talk to me now?

498
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:57,265
Sure. If you could be
any vacation...

499
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,299
Oh!

500
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,701
You didn't let me finish.

501
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,837
If you could be any vacation,
what would you be?

502
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:03,971
I'd be skiing.

503
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,306
Oh, now I'm gonna
hit you for real.

504
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,141
That wasn't for real?
Oh, my God.

505
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:08,109
No, wait, wait, wait!
I was worried!

506
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:10,144
Worried about what?

507
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,346
About you getting hurt.

508
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,815
I don't want your daughters
growing up without a dad.

509
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,450
I know what that's like,
and it sucks.

510
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,751
And I don't want it
to happen to them.

511
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,486
Why didn't you just
say something to me?

512
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,288
Because I didn't want
to get in your head

513
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,723
and have you
freak out again.

514
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:24,559
Yeah, I get it.

515
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,127
It's been a rough year.

516
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:29,697
But I've learned to embrace my
fears. It makes me a better cop.

517
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,731
Tacs one and two are set.

518
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,766
30 minutes until
the bogeys arrive.

519
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,101
Thanks, Boyle.

520
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,670
I love it when
you say "bogeys."

521
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:36,871
So we good?

522
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:39,474
We good.

523
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,242
And for the record...

524
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,544
If I could be any
kind of vacation...

525
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:44,812
I'd be lake trip.

526
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,147
Classic.

527
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:48,749
You're here late.

528
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,885
Ah, you know me.
I love working.

529
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,653
Can't tear me
away from my work.

530
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:56,624
I just love requisitions
and corporate record reports.

531
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,027
Just, you know,
messages from people for Holt.

532
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:02,730
I can imagine
how frightening this must be.

533
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,132
I'm sorry we didn't
catch the guy.

534
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,800
Yeah. It's weird.

535
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,235
It's like,
why do the worst things

536
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,470
always happen
to the best people?

537
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,572
And what's to keep it
from happening again?

538
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,075
We are. Come on.
We're taking you home.

539
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,510
Really?

540
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,415
We installed a second lock
on your front door,

541
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,484
put locks on the windows
by the fire escape,

542
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,752
and set all your lights
on timers.

543
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,121
That makes me feel
so much better.

544
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,189
Thank you, guys.

545
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:30,358
And as a token
of my appreciation,

546
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:33,561
I would like
to give you...

547
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:34,561
These.

548
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,531
Great.

549
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,366
The cool thing is you can
eat whatever you want.

550
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,868
These are right there
with you.

551
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:47,942
Hey!

552
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:49,777
You Vance Vandervaven?

553
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:53,581
Yeah. That's me.
I'll be right there.

554
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,615
You gonna let me
do this, man?

555
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,917
What choice do I have?

556
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,952
You hit me in the arms so hard
they no longer work.

557
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:01,689
All right. It's time
to catch some bad guys.

558
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,124
It good to be back.

559
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,092
Have a fun steroid deal,
sergeant.

560
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:06,460
You're a weird guy,
Jake.

561
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:07,662
Yeah.

562
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,101
The ebony falcon.
No.

563
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,237
The ebony falcon
had no fear.

564
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,506
He's the ebony antelope now.

565
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:20,408
Brave enough
to drink at the lake,

566
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,511
but wise enough
to run from the lions.

567
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,746
Hey, my arms don't work.
Can you scratch my nose?

568
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:28,115
You bet.
Mm-hmm.

569
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,450
Yeah. Thank you.

570
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,253
Morning, Captain.

571
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:35,156
So? How did
sergeant Jeffries do?

572
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,191
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

573
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,259
He was amazing.

574
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,894
He made the buy,
took out the suppliers,

575
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,935
but wisely didn't take on
more than he could handle.

576
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,899
I left one for you.

577
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,467
And you'll be happy to know

578
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:48,336
that he punched me
in the face several times.

579
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,470
That does make me happy.

580
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:52,306
Guess we're being
candid today.

581
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,977
Hey, sarge,

582
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,478
just for the record,

583
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,580
I hope you're on every case with
me for the rest of my career.

584
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,983
I'm not scared
for you at all.

585
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:03,251
Of you a lot.

586
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,786
Thanks, Jake.

587
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,756
Oh, Peralta,
I almost forgot.

588
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,057
My girls made you a card.

589
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,592
To thank you
for keeping me safe.

590
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,394
Oh...

591
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:15,463
They're so full
of potential.

592
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,967
Why would you
show me this?

593
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:24,055
